My name is Steven Arthur Younger.

00:00:45,378 --> 00:00:47,379
l am an American citizen.

3
00:01:02,187 --> 00:01:07,232
My name is Steven Arthur Younger
and l am an American citizen.

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,068

5
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:15,324
l have... l have...

6
00:01:16,326 --> 00:01:18,577
l have certain demands.

7
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:38,764
ln the name of Allah the merciful,
and his prophet Muhammad,

8
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:41,934
peace be upon him.

9
00:01:42,018 --> 00:01:46,647
My name is Yusuf Atta Mohamed.

10
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:50,234
My former name is Steven Arthur Younger.

11
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:49,710
Trace has been on him for three weeks now,
turned up nothing.

12
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:53,755
Goes to mosque, spends time
with his family, he meets friends for tea.

13
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,384
Okay, l'll keep the surveillance guys on him
another week, then l'll pull.

14
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,928
Sorry l'm late.
l was going over the phone logs.

15
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,763
What else do we got? D.J.?

16
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,015
Yeah.

17
00:03:03,099 --> 00:03:05,559
Threat Squad sent us a poison pen.

18
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:09,146
Another flight school called
about an Arab-sounding man

19
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,190
wanting to take flying lessons.

20
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:13,692
Flight school?
My record's three in one week.

21
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,027
Hang-gliding schools don't count.

22
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:18,947
Okay, guys, but we got to check him out.
l'm sorry, but, get into it, please.

23
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,079
Headquarters are doing their review
next week.

24
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:27,539
We don't have much for show-and-tell.

25
00:03:27,624 --> 00:03:29,082
We're on top of things.

26
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,834
Yeah.

27
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:33,420
Helen, l think that l may have
something here.

28
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:37,758
l went back over those new files from ClA
and l found this. Henry Humphries.

29
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:39,551
Now there's actually nothing about him
in the file,

30
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:42,721
it's all been redacted,
but his wife Rina is a Bosnian.

31
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:43,889
-Bosnian?
-Yes.

32
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,974
And from what l can tell
through all the redacting,

33
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:49,436
she was involved in certain objectionable
activities during the war there.

34
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,564
lt doesn't say what, but she's
a devout Muslim, she lives this side of town.

35
00:03:52,649 --> 00:03:55,984
So why doesn't she go to our mosque?
So, l called ClA and asked for open. . .

36
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:57,402
Phil.

37
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,904
A, we have no Bosnian connection,

38
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:00,656
B, Muslim women
don't have to go to mosque,

39
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:05,494
and C, if anyone is going to ask a favor
of another agency, it will be me.

40
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,371
Oh, shoot.

41
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,750
Right. Okay, l'm sorry.

42
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:12,834
Phil?

43
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,758
lt's good work. Why don't you look into it?

44
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:23,053
Okay.

45
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,721
Yes. Thank you.

46
00:04:26,808 --> 00:04:28,934
You were a first office agent once too,
you know.

47
00:04:29,018 --> 00:04:31,019
Yeah, l don't really remember.

48
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,606
l'm gonna go inside,
fix you guys some lunch, okay?

49
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,691
Okay.

50
00:04:42,198 --> 00:04:43,699
Who's that?

51
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,452
Oh, it's the mailman.

52
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:51,039
No. lt's the mailwoman today.

53
00:04:51,916 --> 00:04:53,208
She's cute. You want to see?

54
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:55,711
You always check out the postal workers?

55
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:57,129
Every day.

56
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,798
...and we want to cooperate here on this.

57
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:02,509
Now a dangerous fugitive
is apparently wanted

58
00:05:02,593 --> 00:05:05,762
in connection with a shooting
that took place earlier today.

59
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,473
Yeah, l understand,

60
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,850
but just because he's buying fertilizer,

61
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,853
doesn't necessarily mean
he's making a bomb.

62
00:05:13,354 --> 00:05:16,940
l don't know, maybe he's planting
a garden full of roses for all l know.

63
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,026
Do you recognize this man?

64
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:23,822
His name is Steven Arthur Younger,
he's originally from Akron, Ohio.

65
00:05:23,906 --> 00:05:26,325
He is considered extremely dangerous
and should not be approached...

66
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:27,826
You guys seen this?

67
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,871
Aroused by the news girl, Vince?
Sexy voice, sexy blond hair.

68
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,416
Aroused? Last time he got aroused
was 1 978.

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:36,668
Yeah, with your mother.

70
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:39,838
A nationwide...

71
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:44,134
ln addition, authorities have given us
pictures of these locations.

72
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:49,014
lf you can identify these places,
please call the 800 number on your...

73
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:50,849
Federal authorities
are asking for your help...

74
00:05:50,933 --> 00:05:53,185
lt's on every channel. Who authorized this?

75
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:56,063
Leo, call the Phoenix PD, will you?
Find out what's going on.

76
00:05:56,147 --> 00:06:00,025
That suspect has been identified
as Steven Arthur Younger,

77
00:06:00,109 --> 00:06:02,527
and he's wanted in connection
with the murder of a police officer...

78
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:03,987
l recognize this guy.

79
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,866
Phoenix PD
doesn't know anything about this.

80
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:09,284
All their guys are accounted for.

81
00:06:09,369 --> 00:06:11,286
Who's covering this guy, Younger?

82
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,288
-Oh, shit, he's one of mine.
-Get his file.

83
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,832
Vince, get the Phoenix Field Office
on the line.

84
00:06:15,917 --> 00:06:17,876
Why does the TV have this before we do?

85
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:21,880
All right. Steven Arthur Younger,
member of the King Fahad Mosque.

86
00:06:21,964 --> 00:06:24,841
No current address, no record,
no history of extremism.

87
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:28,136
Says here that he served U.S. Army,
but his military file must be classified

88
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,514
-because there's nothing in it.
-Why isn't that on the board?

89
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:34,184
Hi, this is Special Agent Paul Vincent
from the FBl Los Angeles Field Office.

90
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:35,310
l need everything you've got

91
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,106
-on a Steven Arthur Younger, age 38.
-Helen?

92
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:41,817
Have you seen these news reports?

93
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,610
This guy, Younger,
you got anything on him?

94
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,447
The suspect has been identified
as Steven Arthur Younger,

95
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:50,742
and he's wanted in connection
with the murder of a police officer

96
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:53,328
and the abduction of two young children.

97
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:59,126
-We need to bring them all in.
-What?

98
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:01,503
Can l talk to you in your office?

99
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:10,053
We need to question their families,
their friends, their business associates,

100
00:07:10,138 --> 00:07:11,972
every single potential terrorist link

101
00:07:12,056 --> 00:07:13,890
you've been tracking
for the last nine months,

102
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:16,017
and we have to do it right now.

103
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:17,102
That's hundreds of people, Jack.

104
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,270
We don't have the manpower to do that.

105
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,480
We're getting them.
As many agents as we want.

106
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,442
And we can enlist local law enforcement
if we need it.

107
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:26,111
We need to find this guy and those places.

108
00:07:26,195 --> 00:07:28,447
Drop everything else. This is top priority.

109
00:07:28,531 --> 00:07:31,366
Okay. Can l know what this is about?

110
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:32,909
lt's a classified directive from D.C.

111
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:36,496
You'll be briefed soon enough,
but you better get on it.

112
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:44,504
"So Papa Bear, Mama Bear and Baby Bear
all fell fast asleep."

113
00:07:46,549 --> 00:07:48,091
-You believe it's true?
-No.

114
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,010
Yeah.

115
00:07:50,094 --> 00:07:51,636
-Think l'm making it up?
-Yeah.

116
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:54,055
-No! You?
-No.

117
00:07:58,936 --> 00:08:01,396
Why don't you guys go to your room,

118
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:06,234
find the bears, make sure they're all asleep,
okay? Go! Go ahead. Hurry. Run.

119
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,449
Hello?

120
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,993
Hi, l'm Agent Phillips,
Federal Bureau of lnvestigation.

121
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,703
l'd like to come in and ask you
a few questions, please.

122
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:18,788
-We found them !
-We got them !

123
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:22,542
Good ! Good, sweetie pie.
Come, let's put them all to bed. Let's go!

124
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,381
Hey, l was just about to call you.

125
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,926
-Do l have a problem?
-With what? What's happened?

126
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,596
Well, there's some guys outside my gate
claiming to be from the FBl.

127
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:36,806
That's impossible.
Nobody knows where you are.

128
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:37,974
You don't know anything about this?

129
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,977
No. But l'm on it. l'll get straight back to you.

130
00:08:41,062 --> 00:08:44,606
No, l'll take care of it.
But you need to relocate us immediately.

131
00:08:44,690 --> 00:08:45,690
H, listen to me.

132
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,484
This is my family.

133
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:49,194
Goddamn it.

134
00:08:50,738 --> 00:08:53,198
We've got 80 suspects down there,
more on the way.

135
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:54,950
These are a yes, these are a no.

136
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:59,120
You make it damn clear that it may be
a military facility, but we have custody.

137
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:01,581
Of course you read them their rights.
What kind of question is that?

138
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:02,707
Can you hold, please?

139
00:09:02,792 --> 00:09:05,210
Just found out that Younger has an ex-wife
and two small children.

140
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:07,128
They left the house five days ago,
haven't been seen since.

141
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:10,882
Put a material witness warrant on her.
She's bound to know something. Find her.

142
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,470
Hey, Mike, l'm gonna have to call you back.

143
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,139
-Brody.
-Special Agent Brody,

144
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,474
my name is Charles Thompson.

145
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:21,726
I'm connected
with the Defense lntelligence Agency.

146
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:24,563
l need to discuss with you
a matter of extreme national security.

147
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:26,064
What do you mean, connected?

148
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:28,942
-Listen to me.
-How did you get my personal number?

149
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,735
You got a thousand new files today.

150
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,280
l wouldn't know that or your number
if l wasn't for real, right?

151
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,823
l'm not gonna discuss this with you.

152
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:39,661
Listen to me, please.
A ClA file was sent earlier to you in error.

153
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:44,040
Name of Henry Humphries. lt's a mistake.
He's an extremely dangerous man.

154
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,709
-PIease hoId.
-No!

155
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:49,296
-Who is that?
-l don't know. Nobody has this number.

156
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,672
l have a lot of files here.

157
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,632
l know you got the goddamn file!

158
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:55,468
lf you sent people there,
withdraw them immediately.

159
00:09:55,553 --> 00:09:59,097
Do not approach him.
l repeat, you must not approach him.

160
00:09:59,181 --> 00:10:00,223
Can you hold?

161
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:03,643
-Phillips and Huntley went there.
-Call them.

162
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:07,606
"Personal information restricted.
This man is armed and dangerous.

163
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,109
"No approach to be made to subject
or family under any circumstances.

164
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:15,864
"Department heads, contact
Charles Thompson before any other action."

165
00:10:15,948 --> 00:10:17,449
-They're not answering.
-Oh, shit.

166
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,409
Okay, l'm on it. D.J. , let's go!

167
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,048
That's their car.

168
00:10:42,558 --> 00:10:45,226
-Camera.
-The door is open. Go.

169
00:10:52,777 --> 00:10:53,777
l'm in here.

170
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:56,821
FBl ! Move to the door so l can see you !

171
00:10:57,406 --> 00:10:59,074
Show me your badge.

172
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,452
-Right here.
-Let me see it!

173
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:04,913
Right here!

174
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,707
Coming out.

175
00:11:16,926 --> 00:11:18,593
You take one more step and l'll shoot.

176
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,761
Oh, please.

177
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,933
-Put the gun down.
-No way.

178
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,726
Not you. Her.

179
00:11:26,811 --> 00:11:29,354
Put it on the mantel. Back away, slowly.

180
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,110
Hands on your head !

181
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,695
-Hands on your head !
-Lower your voice!

182
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,571
Do not frighten my children.

183
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,450
Who the fuck sent you idiots to my house?

184
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,382
-l'm Special Agent Brody.
-Where are my children?

185
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,925
With your wife. They're fine.

186
00:12:00,761 --> 00:12:02,095
You have a file on me?

187
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:06,224
Henry Harold Humphries.
ls that your real name?

188
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:09,310
-What do you think?
-You've been read your rights?

189
00:12:09,395 --> 00:12:11,604
-My guy's coming.
-No one knows you're here.

190
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,691
Did you send these assholes to my house?
Are you responsible for that?

191
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,401
Do you have a first name you can give me?

192
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,485
A real one?

193
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,572
Okay, okay, let's play the game.

194
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,116
You can call me H.

195
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,826
What's your first name, Agent Brody?

196
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:27,078
You kidnapped and detained
two federal agents.

197
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,872
-You admit to that, right?
-They came to my house.

198
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:31,207
My children were there.
l could've killed them.

199
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,835
So you think you're above the law, is that it?

200
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,424
Do you recognize this man?

201
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:41,718
Yeah. He's on TV, right?

202
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,804
Helen, l'm sorry, this interview is terminated.

203
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,306
l depend on you. Come on !

204
00:12:46,390 --> 00:12:50,268
lt's a screw-up.
Your name is on some list ClA sent the FBl.

205
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:52,771
No one told me.
l can't believe you let this happen.

206
00:12:52,855 --> 00:12:54,773
You sent us his file. Don't blame FBl.

207
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,692
Really? Did you check the leads
against the DlA priority list

208
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,611
with the little red tags saying
"Do Not Touch"?

209
00:12:59,695 --> 00:13:00,862
Wait, he's under protection?

210
00:13:00,946 --> 00:13:02,739
This is my life.
How could you screw this up?

211
00:13:02,823 --> 00:13:05,909
He's a target. He thought your guys
were killers. Sorry about that.

212
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:08,119
Thanks for your heartfelt fucking apology.

213
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:09,204
Who are you?

214
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,331
Probably best not to ask.

215
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,003
Jack, what's going on?

216
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:19,380
Can l talk to you for a second?

217
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:25,470
l can't give you all the details right now,

218
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:29,098
but we're being moved
to a centralized command facility.

219
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:31,935
You gonna help me with this one, okay?

220
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,269
Okay, of course.

221
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,064
But where is this facility?

222
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,734
lt's classified.

223
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:03,091
What the hell is this place?

224
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:13,476
- Agent Brody? All right, follow me, please.
-Yep?

225
00:14:27,157 --> 00:14:29,409
At this point,
l need to take all of your firearms.

226
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,036
-You're not taking my gun.
-Ma'am, l'm sorry. The rules. . .

227
00:14:32,121 --> 00:14:35,039
-lt's okay, son, let her keep it.
-Yes, sir.

228
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:39,002
l'm General Paulson,
l'm leading the operation here.

229
00:14:39,086 --> 00:14:40,503
-You're Brody?
-Yes.

230
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:43,423
l know you haven't been briefed on this,
but you guys will be assisting us

231
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,301
with investigative duties
under my command here.

232
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,510
So l'll show you to your offices and. . .

233
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,387
No disrespect, sir, but outside martial law,

234
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:51,890
the military has no jurisdiction
on home soil.

235
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:53,892
Well, there's the Defense Authorization Act.

236
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:56,311
The President has the authority
to use the armed forces

237
00:14:56,395 --> 00:15:00,106
to suppress any insurrection,
unlawful combination or conspiracy.

238
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,859
This all went through Congress in '07.

239
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:05,320
Agent Helen ! Good to see you again.

240
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,406
-General, nice to see you.
-Charlie. You all know each other?

241
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,074
Yeah, we met earlier. A little mix-up.

242
00:15:10,159 --> 00:15:12,201
What are you doing here?
Who are you guys?

243
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:14,412
-lndependent contractors?
-What agency?

244
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:17,290
Oh, no agency would claim us.
Right, General?

245
00:15:17,374 --> 00:15:19,042
Okay, everyone.
lf you could follow me, please.

246
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:25,965
Right in here, please.

247
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:31,346
Where are the rest of my people?

248
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:33,348
We're working with the staff we have here
from this room.

249
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:37,101
Secure lines are being set up with all
field offices as well as other agencies.

250
00:15:37,186 --> 00:15:38,227
What is this place?

251
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:41,189
Nowhere. lt doesn't exist. Neither do we.

252
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:44,609
Hey, guys, l need you to see this.

253
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:52,450
ln the name of Allah the merciful,
and his prophet Muhammad,

254
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:54,494
peace be upon him.

255
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:58,456
My name is Yusuf Atta Mohamed.

256
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,711
My former name is Steven Arthur Younger.

257
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,965
This is Location One.

258
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:10,301
We took a screen capture
of all the locations, cleaned them up,

259
00:16:10,386 --> 00:16:13,388
took him out and then took that thing out.

260
00:16:13,472 --> 00:16:17,058
Some of you will recognize this.

261
00:16:19,019 --> 00:16:20,478
It is a bomb.

262
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:22,230
You've seen this?

263
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:31,447
l've placed three bombs
in three American cities.

264
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:37,412
All three are identical,
all three are in urban areas,

265
00:16:38,747 --> 00:16:40,248
and aII three

266
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,211
are nucIear bombs.

267
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:47,213
Jesus.

268
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,758
l have demands which will be met by you,

269
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,970
or these bombs will explode.

270
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:59,225
l will give you these demands

271
00:17:01,270 --> 00:17:02,645
at a Iater date.

272
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,483
This is Location Two.

273
00:17:11,405 --> 00:17:13,322
This is Location Three.

274
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:21,330
All three bombs are set to explode

275
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:27,003
on Friday the 21 st, at noon Pacific Time.

276
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:30,048
Jesus. That's only four days from now.

277
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:35,428
The fissionabIe materiaI
is shielded effectively in lead and water...

278
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:38,806
You can check the tech details later
if you want.

279
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:43,269
People, if there's a one percent chance
the threat is serious,

280
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,562
this is a 1 00%.

281
00:17:44,646 --> 00:17:47,565
How could an individual
manufacture nuclear weapons?

282
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:51,861
He's one of us. A specialist.
Career military, Delta Force.

283
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:55,031
Expert in explosives, bomb disposal,

284
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:58,242
specialized in field nuclear weapons.

285
00:17:58,327 --> 00:18:02,246
Served in lraq to check out nukes.
He knows what he's doing.

286
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,123
He's 1 00% American.

287
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:07,418
When he was a teenager,
his father moved the family to lslamabad

288
00:18:07,503 --> 00:18:09,087
to work at the embassy there.

289
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:11,130
He's fluent in Farsi and Arabic.

290
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:14,759
Do we know if there's a way he could
get his hands on fissionable material?

291
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:19,138
Three years ago, he was on a team
checking nuclear facilities in Russia.

292
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,683
The Russians can't
account for 1 5 to 1 8 pounds.

293
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,479
They can't be accurate.
Around five pounds on each bomb.

294
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:29,690
That's six to ten million casualties, folks.

295
00:18:30,943 --> 00:18:34,112
But do we have any direct evidence
that this is real?

296
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:38,574
Tehran paid him 20 million to get
nuclear materials out of Russia and into lran.

297
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:40,952
Then they lost track of him and the money.

298
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:42,120
How do you know that?

299
00:18:42,204 --> 00:18:43,579
They told us themselves.

300
00:18:43,664 --> 00:18:46,457
They didn't want us using Younger
as an excuse to bomb the crap out of them.

301
00:18:46,542 --> 00:18:48,167
What does he want? Why is he doing this?

302
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:52,088
We don't know. So far,
he's made no demands, no further contact.

303
00:18:52,172 --> 00:18:55,258
So we have 72 hours to figure out
where he's hiding.

304
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,594
The focus of your investigation isn't
going to be about Younger's whereabouts.

305
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:02,932
lt's about the location of those three bombs.
That is your immediate priority.

306
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,017
But surely, if we find him,
we'll find the bombs.

307
00:19:05,102 --> 00:19:07,436
Not necessarily, Agent Helen.

308
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:13,442
You already have him, don't you, General?

309
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:18,281
He was arrested 24 hours ago?
Why didn't you come out and tell us?

310
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,284
You didn't have clearance.
lt's classified through military intelligence.

311
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,828
"Military intelligence." The great oxymoron.

312
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:24,954
How was he caught?

313
00:19:25,038 --> 00:19:27,999
A security officer saw him in a mall
in Phoenix.

314
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:32,587
His picture is plastered all over the country
and he goes to a mall?

315
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:36,257
People, this is Colonel Kerkmejian.
He'll escort you to view the prisoner.

316
00:19:36,341 --> 00:19:38,342
You're allowed to observe and that's it.

317
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:41,429
General, when can we interrogate this man?

318
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:44,098
At the moment, the military is in charge
of any interrogation.

319
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:46,601
lf that changes, we'll let you know.

320
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,477
Colonel, if you would.

321
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,605
-This way, please.
-Please.

322
00:20:01,783 --> 00:20:06,537
We have experts from multiple agencies,
the military, nuke specialists, psychologists,

323
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:09,123
analyzing every word and movement
he makes.

324
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,833
Who authorized this?

325
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:13,628
Everything here
is within operational parameters.

326
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,712
We never strike him.

327
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:19,550
Hot, cold, sleep deprivation, intense noise,
bright lights, threats of violence.

328
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:21,385
He must be terrified.

329
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:24,347
Where are the dogs? There should be dogs.

330
00:20:24,973 --> 00:20:27,475
lt's the amateur hour here, Charlie.
This is never gonna work.

331
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:30,561
Yeah, well,
you're gonna have to make it work.

332
00:20:34,524 --> 00:20:36,734
You want to get in there and talk to him?

333
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,654
Yes. But l don't need your help to do that.

334
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,822
Believe me, you will.

335
00:20:53,001 --> 00:20:55,044
Tell me he's not here.

336
00:21:08,517 --> 00:21:09,517
What's he doing?

337
00:21:11,019 --> 00:21:13,104
Oh, shit, here we go.

338
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:19,527
What the hell?

339
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:26,033
No. No way, you fucking animal.
You keep away from him.

340
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,745
-Hello.
-Back the fuck. . .

341
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,914
Get in there now!

342
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,092
l never laid a hand on the prisoner.

343
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:45,886
Don't hurt him ! You'll need him later.

344
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:51,434
l'm going in now, Colonel.

345
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:53,728
What? No, you don't have authorization.

346
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,479
Do you intend to obstruct the FBl?

347
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,149
Where the hell is Paulson?
And get him out of here!

348
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,284
Shit.

349
00:22:08,702 --> 00:22:12,747
Mr. Younger, l'm Special Agent Brody, FBl.

350
00:22:12,831 --> 00:22:14,915
Your situation here is illegal.

351
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,252
And l'm going to get you out of here,
so you and l can sit down and talk.

352
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:22,631
l think you'll find that this is entirely legal.
And necessary.

353
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:25,009
Necessary?

354
00:22:25,093 --> 00:22:27,011
ln the War on Terror.

355
00:22:27,262 --> 00:22:30,097
The FBl woman, she's in the cell alone.

356
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:34,435
Thank you. Could you please dry my arms?
They're really cold.

357
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:41,359
You looked at my watch.
Would you like to know the time?

358
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,444
1 0: 1 5 in the morning.

359
00:22:47,532 --> 00:22:49,533
Mr. Younger,

360
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,869
l'd like to ask you a few questions.

361
00:22:51,953 --> 00:22:53,913
About your wife Jehan
and your two children.

362
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:56,624
What do you want to know?

363
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,919
You must have been very upset
when she left you.

364
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,340
l'm not upset. l accept my fate.

365
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,593
You should accept yours.

366
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:10,221
-Why are you doing this, Mr. Younger?
-Yusuf. My name is Yusuf.

367
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:11,972
All right, Yusuf.

368
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:15,726
They're gonna ask me about this

369
00:23:15,811 --> 00:23:18,813
and l would really like to be
able to tell them something.

370
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:24,193
l'm sorry, nice lady. lt's too soon.

371
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,824
Get her out of here.

372
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,327
Ma'am. Ma'am.

373
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:39,834
And you, soldier,
get some goddamn results!

374
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:47,550
That's what l'm asking you.

375
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:49,552
Call me back.

376
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:53,764
You saw what's going on in there?
lt's arguably illegal and ineffective.

377
00:23:53,849 --> 00:23:56,142
Any information he gives
is probably unreliable.

378
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,685
lf we work with these people, our integrity. . .

379
00:23:57,769 --> 00:24:00,521
At the moment, they have official sanction.

380
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,356
Jack, l can't believe that.

381
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,235
What about the General Counsel memo on
coercive interrogations? There's no way. . .

382
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,780
Look, the Director's Office has ordered us

383
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,907
to assist the military wherever possible.

384
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:16,787
For now, we observe
and run our investigation simultaneously.

385
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:19,915
Just keep me informed, okay?

386
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:26,464
We have the guy but we can't say so.
Why the hell not?

387
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:28,466
Because officially, he doesn't exist.

388
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,925
His face is all over the country!

389
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,135
And we keep it there.

390
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:35,306
Faces lead to places. Our absolute priority
is finding these locations.

391
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:38,142
Someone must know where they are,
and it's likely to be friends or family.

392
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:40,269
Why can't we interrogate this guy?

393
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:42,313
We are currently negotiating that.

394
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:44,690
-Negotiating?
-Guys.

395
00:24:44,774 --> 00:24:46,358
Please.

396
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:50,237
-D.J. , anything new on the ex-wife?
-Yeah, l just talked to the guys at LAX.

397
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,158
Two days ago, the wife and kids
tried to board a plane to Saudi Arabia,

398
00:24:54,242 --> 00:24:56,702
but were denied a visa at the last minute.

399
00:24:56,786 --> 00:24:58,412
They're likely still in the country.

400
00:24:58,497 --> 00:25:01,749
Phillips, l need you to coordinate a check
with rental agencies.

401
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:04,668
He must have transported the bombs
cross-country in some kind of truck.

402
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:05,753
He wouldn't have used his real name.

403
00:25:05,837 --> 00:25:08,672
Okay, l'll get local PDs out at port cities
and border towns.

404
00:25:08,757 --> 00:25:12,176
Vince, get on to Frank and his team.

405
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:16,805
Organize a trace on his lnternet, phone,
credit cards, travel bookings.

406
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:19,225
Get National Security Letters
for anyone who gives you a hard time.

407
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:20,309
You got it.

408
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,229
Helen. Can l have a word with you?

409
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:26,815
We need you to negotiate. With H.

410
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,567
He's asking for you.

411
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:42,164
l hear you're a specialist interrogator.
Ex-Army?

412
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,832
Made me the man l am today.

413
00:25:44,626 --> 00:25:47,336
ls that how you work with colleagues?
You beat them?

414
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:50,923
He's a cheap sadist.
Younger knows all about those techniques.

415
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:52,883
He was trained by the Army
to withstand them.

416
00:25:52,968 --> 00:25:54,343
That stuff's not gonna work on him.

417
00:25:54,427 --> 00:25:57,763
What are the chances they'll use you
after that little show?

418
00:25:57,847 --> 00:25:59,348
You thought that was a show?

419
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,643
You wanted the other interrogators
to look like the bad guys.

420
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,812
They are the bad guys.

421
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:09,233
So, you talked to Younger.
Learn anything else about him?

422
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,986
A little. You?

423
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:13,988
Oh, no, that's his file there.

424
00:26:14,072 --> 00:26:16,282
This is yours.

425
00:26:18,451 --> 00:26:20,035
lt's classified.

426
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,580
l see why they picked you, though.

427
00:26:22,831 --> 00:26:25,791
-Harvard Law, graduated with honors.
-Who gave that to you?

428
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,961
Counter-terrorism. Good choice.
Let me see what else.

429
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:31,297
No boyfriends.

430
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,592
And no children.
Chose a career over a family.

431
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:37,011
Better watch that,
they gonna think you're a lesbian.

432
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:43,726
So, you didn't get anything
out of him yet, huh? What a surprise.

433
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:46,520
Yeah, well, the General here
has a great deal for you.

434
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:50,524
The price is right but you can't beat up
any more interrogators.

435
00:26:50,609 --> 00:26:51,609
l'm in charge.

436
00:26:51,693 --> 00:26:55,613
You'll be brought in as we deem necessary,
take turns interrogating with the others.

437
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:59,241
l work alone with an assistant
and one other interrogator of my choice

438
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:00,576
who takes over when l need a break.

439
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:02,036
You don't call the shots here, l do.

440
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:07,291
You want me to do my work,
you will treat me with respect.

441
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:09,793
Especially in front of a lady.

442
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,378
Look, we're all under a lot of pressure here.

443
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:14,173
-Why don't we just back off. . .
-You're a grown man. Deal with it.

444
00:27:14,257 --> 00:27:16,508
Future of this country is in your hands.

445
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:20,304
Lose the committee, l lead with one other.

446
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,264
Who?

447
00:27:24,351 --> 00:27:25,392
Her.

448
00:27:25,935 --> 00:27:28,646
No way.
She's part of a side investigation here,

449
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:30,898
she doesn't know the first thing
about military interrogation.

450
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,651
-There's absolutely no. . .
-Give him what he wants.

451
00:27:33,735 --> 00:27:36,236
And get him in there now, General.

452
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,657
Why do you want me?

453
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:41,992
You've got integrity, l like that.

454
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,455
And these people are dangerous.
l may need protection.

455
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:50,918
Do you have a plan?

456
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:54,421
l shake him up, you shake him down, okay?

457
00:28:03,431 --> 00:28:04,973
Outstanding !

458
00:28:05,266 --> 00:28:09,645
ClA Human Resources Training Manual,
circa 1 983.

459
00:28:09,729 --> 00:28:10,896
"The Honduran Edition," right?

460
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,856
People, we have a new specialist joining us.

461
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:16,318
From now on, there will be no observers.
Everyone out, please.

462
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:20,114
Lubitchich, have you told him how small his
penis is? They really hate that.

463
00:28:20,281 --> 00:28:22,950
All military personnel will leave at once.

464
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:25,536
The rest of you, consult with your agencies.

465
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,620
What the hell is happening?

466
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,914
l am. You're out.

467
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,210
ls my equipment here yet?

468
00:28:33,294 --> 00:28:35,671
Yeah, it's right over there,
and Alvarez is here.

469
00:28:35,755 --> 00:28:38,298
Hello, my friend. Wheel it right in.

470
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:46,140
Can one of you guys get me
that fire ax over there, please?

471
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:49,643
Fire ax, over there.

472
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,900
Charlie, could you call my wife?
Ask her to bring my food down here, please.

473
00:28:56,985 --> 00:29:00,863
-She can't come in here, it's top secret.
-l need my wife here.

474
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:03,031
And he's very particular about his food.

475
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:07,536
-Thanks.
-Colonel Kerkmejian, you're in command.

476
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:09,413
Me, sir? Aren't you?

477
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,250
l'm doing it now.

478
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,337
Let's get him down.

479
00:29:19,466 --> 00:29:21,383
So, how does this work?

480
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:22,926
l never know that.

481
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,179
And the really great thing is

482
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,805
he doesn't either.

483
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,442
Agent Brody?

484
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,360
We're gonna need your eyes.

485
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:44,323
Could you look for any interesting tics,

486
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:47,075
eye movements, fear, jitters,

487
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,161
things like that, please?

488
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:53,207
Mr. Younger! My name is H.

489
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:56,293
l'm going to be conducting
your interrogation from here on out.

490
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,628
We've met.

491
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,756
That's right. Sorry you had to see that.

492
00:30:01,049 --> 00:30:05,177
And l want you to know,
my interest lies only with you.

493
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:10,557
Now, l have one question for you.
lt's a simple one.

494
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,145
PIease teII me
where you placed the three bombs.

495
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,356
This is not what we talked about.

496
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,858
That's because you were only listening
to yourself.

497
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:23,320
Start with the furthest location, please.

498
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,539
Mr. Younger?

499
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,460
You understand
what l'm about to do to you?

500
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:44,675
Oh, my God !

501
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,101
What? What? lt's only a finger.

502
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:57,145
What, not really a whole finger, it's. . .

503
00:30:57,772 --> 00:30:59,314
Tape him, then leave him.

504
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,817
-Get him out!
-All right!

505
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,406
So that's your technique?
You're a fucking joke.

506
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:09,867
You expect me to be part of that?

507
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:11,493
All right, all right, no more fingers.

508
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,704
You think you're going back in there?

509
00:31:13,788 --> 00:31:15,455
Well, why don't we ask the man?

510
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:19,960
He's got direct access, highest levels,
back door, no names, no records.

511
00:31:20,753 --> 00:31:24,464
Well, tell me. Do l have authorization or not?

512
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,800
Higher authority believes
that we should all do

513
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:31,054
what we think is best for our country
and its people.

514
00:31:33,641 --> 00:31:34,808
Alvarez, bag him.

515
00:31:35,935 --> 00:31:38,395
Colonel, would you lose the gorillas?

516
00:31:38,479 --> 00:31:40,564
-lf l'm in charge here, l. . .
-You're not.

517
00:31:40,648 --> 00:31:42,900
He is and we need to do something
about that.

518
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,402
l won't authorize him to continue. . .

519
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:49,156
So let it happen without your authorization.
Then you're covered, right?

520
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:55,245
-One of my guys stays.
-Deal.

521
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,415
We need to stop this at once.
That man needs to be pulled out right now!

522
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:00,792
You want to leave, that's fine.

523
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:08,842
Lay everything out on this table, please.

524
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:28,737
l haven't seen you since Afghanistan, right?

525
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:35,035
When you're done, you can wait outside.

526
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:53,971
Mr. Younger, are you ready for this?

527
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:56,765
No.

528
00:32:57,892 --> 00:32:59,601
No one ever is.

529
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,279
All your worst fears,

530
00:33:11,364 --> 00:33:13,490
all your nightmares

531
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:15,409
are right here.

532
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,209
Oh, my God ! Oh, my God !

533
00:33:24,293 --> 00:33:25,419
Get General Paulson here right now!

534
00:33:25,503 --> 00:33:26,670
Colonel, the Geneva Convention
states that. . .

535
00:33:26,754 --> 00:33:29,631
The Military Commissions Act,
no unlawful enemy combatants

536
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:30,966
may invoke the Geneva Convention.

537
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,634
That act declares torture illegal.

538
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,845
Unlawful combatants have no right
to habeas corpus.

539
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:36,763
They can't bring any claims to court,
so how do they prove it?

540
00:33:36,848 --> 00:33:40,142
That's alien unlawful enemy combatants.
This man is an American citizen.

541
00:33:40,226 --> 00:33:43,270
That was revoked yesterday.
He's now stateless.

542
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:45,188
You can't do that.

543
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,316
Sir, General Paulson
can't come back right now.

544
00:33:48,401 --> 00:33:49,985
He says you're in charge, and carry on.

545
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:51,361
-He says what?
-Carry on, sir.

546
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,114
This is illegal.
l will not allow this to happen !

547
00:33:55,616 --> 00:34:00,162
The plutonium pit consists of

548
00:34:00,246 --> 00:34:02,998
three canisters of plutonium E,

549
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,460
one and a half pounds.

550
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:10,297
Another one and half pounds,

551
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:15,052
and another one and a half pounds.

552
00:34:16,262 --> 00:34:18,055
We have to stop this.

553
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,849
Let me call you back.

554
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,518
Can you shut the door, please?

555
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:28,899
What he's doing in there
is a violation of every. . .

556
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:31,359
Did you interview the suspect again?

557
00:34:31,444 --> 00:34:32,986
-No.
-Then why have you left the room?

558
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:36,990
Jack, the suspect is being tortured.
This is unconstitutional.

559
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:42,329
Helen, if those bombs go off,
there will be no fucking Constitution !

560
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:56,384
Main Justice and the Director's Office
are aware of what's going on here,

561
00:34:56,469 --> 00:35:01,014
but we are powerless to stop it
and the situation is too grave to pull out.

562
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:04,684
When you're in there you act as a witness,
and when this is over,

563
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,480
we'll bring a civil rights prosecution
against these bastards.

564
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:11,483
ln the meantime,
you are lncident Commander.

565
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,363
We need you to do everything in your power
to find those bombs.

566
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:19,366
Do you understand?

567
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:39,386
You've removed your name tag.

568
00:36:10,918 --> 00:36:12,711
Do you mind if l. . .

569
00:36:19,343 --> 00:36:20,677
You all right?

570
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:26,600
You know, it hits everybody like that at first.
You get used to it.

571
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,229
You didn't even question him.

572
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:35,150
So this blood on my jacket would be all right
if l'd gotten some information?

573
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:36,943
Well, you're not gonna get any.

574
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,363
You do this and he'll say anything you want,
and none of it will be true.

575
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:43,241
Physical torture doesn't work.

576
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:46,703
So, l guess that's why they've been using it

577
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,664
since the beginning of human history, huh?

578
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:50,749
For fun?

579
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,878
That's what makes you so special, is it?
Our secret weapon against the enemy?

580
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:59,466
lt's not about the enemy. lt's about us.

581
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,134
Our weakness.

582
00:37:03,137 --> 00:37:05,388
We're on the losing side, Helen.

583
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:09,559
We're afraid, they're not.

584
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,771
We doubt, they believe.

585
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:14,105
We have values.

586
00:37:14,190 --> 00:37:17,025
And our values have cost us
how many lives?

587
00:37:17,526 --> 00:37:20,946
lt's not about that guy out there.
He's not the problem. You are.

588
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,739
Whatever happened to rapport building?

589
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,325
Takes time, possibly months.

590
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:29,037
Look, this is a process.
He has to believe l have no limits.

591
00:37:29,121 --> 00:37:31,915
-You're not even asking him questions.
-That's your job.

592
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:32,958
Well, then, let me do it.

593
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,251
-You want to work with me?
-No!

594
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:37,671
How about working beside me? Take turns?

595
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:51,351
Go ahead.

596
00:38:14,792 --> 00:38:16,876
Yusuf, he's not gonna stop.

597
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:23,341
Why are you letting him do this?

598
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,971
We're gonna find these bombs anyway.

599
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:32,058
You talk to me,
and maybe we can make it easy.

600
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,395
Otherwise that bastard is gonna keep at you.

601
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,480
lt's okay.

602
00:38:38,858 --> 00:38:40,525
l'm all prepared.

603
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:47,532
Your friends at the mosque. Your family.

604
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,910
Did you want to impress them with this?

605
00:38:52,371 --> 00:38:53,705
Your wife?

606
00:38:54,915 --> 00:38:56,291
Your kids?

607
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,212
Oh, my God.

608
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:03,548
Your kids.

609
00:39:04,091 --> 00:39:06,009
Nobody told you, did they?

610
00:39:06,093 --> 00:39:08,720
Your wife tried to leave the country,

611
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:10,805
go to Saudi Arabia,

612
00:39:11,474 --> 00:39:13,224
but she was denied a visa.

613
00:39:13,309 --> 00:39:15,560
They could be hiding anywhere.

614
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,605
You don't want them blown to pieces.

615
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:21,941
Yusuf. Yusuf, you love them.

616
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,653
You must love them so much.

617
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:31,117
You have two days to agree to my demands.

618
00:39:32,286 --> 00:39:34,037
God damn it,
you haven't made any demands.

619
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:37,332
Don't swear. God hears you.
He sees everything.

620
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:38,792
He sees you.

621
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,711
Allah loves those that do good, not evil.

622
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,215
l read the Koran. l admire it.

623
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,717
Allah blesses a just war.

624
00:39:47,802 --> 00:39:51,262
Give me one of the bombs.
Just one of the bombs. Just give me proof.

625
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,014
Then they'll listen to you,
they'll know you're serious.

626
00:39:53,099 --> 00:39:54,432
Tomorrow.

627
00:39:55,142 --> 00:39:56,684
They'll listen tomorrow.

628
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,353
What happens tomorrow?
The deadline is Friday.

629
00:39:58,437 --> 00:39:59,437
-Time's up.
-Wait!

630
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:02,232
What happens tomorrow? Tell me, please!

631
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,692
Help me to help you, okay?

632
00:40:04,777 --> 00:40:06,736
l don't need your help.

633
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:09,572
l can take it. l deserve it.

634
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,492
-You can stay if you want.
-What happens tomorrow?

635
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:13,660
Hit him.

636
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:50,989
Would you like me to kill you now?

637
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:54,492
Do what you have to.

638
00:40:55,244 --> 00:40:57,203
l can't lose.

639
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,336
You're practical.

640
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:09,799
You're a relativist, a consequentialist.

641
00:41:09,884 --> 00:41:11,718
You know what l mean?

642
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:15,472
Nah, of course you don't.

643
00:41:15,556 --> 00:41:18,516
You only read religious books.

644
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:25,565
What l'm doing here is good for my people

645
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:29,736
if l get results, if l save them.

646
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,905
You see,

647
00:41:32,781 --> 00:41:36,743
there is no H and Younger.

648
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,995
There's only victory and defeat.

649
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:41,498
The winner gets to take
the moral high ground

650
00:41:41,582 --> 00:41:44,417
because they get to write the history books.

651
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:47,504
The loser just loses.

652
00:41:50,216 --> 00:41:52,759
The only miscalculation in your plan

653
00:41:53,636 --> 00:41:54,969
was me.

654
00:41:56,597 --> 00:42:01,559
You see, l will tear your eyes out,
but you'll not tear my building down.

655
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:07,524
Every man, no matter how strong he is,
lies to himself about something.

656
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:11,069
l will find your lie

657
00:42:11,153 --> 00:42:12,487
and l will break you.

658
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:16,324
You'll be a hero.

659
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,648
Yes?

660
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,693
Good.

661
00:43:34,653 --> 00:43:35,945
His wife is here.

662
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,655
About time.

663
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:39,949
H, Rina's here.

664
00:43:50,878 --> 00:43:52,128
Alvarez.

665
00:43:53,589 --> 00:43:56,341
Dim the lights, take an hour break.

666
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,637
Okay, Colonel?

667
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:03,723
Tell your wife nothing. You understand?

668
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,392
-l'm going in.
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey.

669
00:44:08,312 --> 00:44:09,937
Wait ten minutes.

670
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:13,566
When the adrenaline wears off
he'll start to weep.

671
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:16,819
Then you can talk to him. Not before.

672
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:19,405
lf he's asleep, zap him.

673
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,408
Just press this green button,
send a little shock through him

674
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,327
and it'll wake him up, okay?

675
00:44:24,411 --> 00:44:26,621
But only you can press the button.

676
00:44:26,705 --> 00:44:28,081
You got that? Just her.

677
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:29,499
l'm not gonna do it.

678
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,501
Well, then you stay here.

679
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:33,795
You can't run away from this.

680
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,255
Run away?

681
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:40,218
Some of us don't have that option, Helen.

682
00:44:40,302 --> 00:44:45,014
l got nowhere to run.
l'm a prisoner here myself.

683
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,933
Ask the ClA.

684
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:49,686
Ask them.

685
00:44:56,026 --> 00:44:58,194
What the hell is that about?

686
00:44:58,278 --> 00:45:01,364
He's done some bad things.
People out there are looking for him.

687
00:45:01,448 --> 00:45:03,032
They want payback.

688
00:45:03,117 --> 00:45:06,828
So he's done this many times before.
Does it ever work?

689
00:45:08,288 --> 00:45:10,248
You've become one of us.

690
00:45:10,332 --> 00:45:13,584
"That's terrible," we say, "but does it work?"

691
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:29,642
You haven't been sleeping, you poor thing.

692
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:36,816
-He's fallen asleep.
-What?

693
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,152
-He's asleep.
-We need H back in here.

694
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,738
Brody, push the damn button.
The bastard's not supposed to sleep!

695
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:43,239
-You heard H.
-l'll do it.

696
00:45:43,323 --> 00:45:44,657
Don't, don't do it.

697
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:48,244
That's enough. Turn it off.

698
00:45:48,328 --> 00:45:51,038
-Turn it off! For God's sake!
-l can't!

699
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,167
My God, it's killing him !

700
00:45:56,086 --> 00:45:59,005
-Where is it? Where the fuck is it?
-Fuck!

701
00:46:13,896 --> 00:46:16,314
That's beautiful, Katie May.
Did you make that for me?

702
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,149
I did it at schooI.

703
00:46:21,779 --> 00:46:23,196
You bastard.

704
00:46:23,363 --> 00:46:24,614
You mind?

705
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:28,576
Kids, Daddy's got to go.
But l'll be home soon, okay?

706
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:30,369
Bye-bye, Daddy.

707
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:32,330
-l love you.
-Love you, too.

708
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,626
Current ran for 1 5 seconds, he'll be fine.

709
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:37,710
You nearly killed him.

710
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:40,505
And you all tried to save him, right?

711
00:46:40,589 --> 00:46:42,882
l wanted him to see that.
He needs to feel hope.

712
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,302
-You gonna find these fucking bombs?
-Nope, that's your job.

713
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,263
Special Agent Brody, this is my wife, Rina.

714
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:55,770
-Got to go, doll. Duty calls.
-Okay, love. Good-bye.

715
00:47:01,568 --> 00:47:03,653
You know. You know what he does.

716
00:47:03,737 --> 00:47:04,821
Of course.

717
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,949
How can you? Your family, your children.

718
00:47:08,033 --> 00:47:11,410
You live in the same house with him.
He's not normal.

719
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,912
Normal?

720
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,998
Let me tell you something.

721
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:19,210
l lost my first family in Bosnia.

722
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,128
Three men come to my house.

723
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,675
They rape me in front of my family,
then kill everyone.

724
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:28,261
My little boy, they kill last.

725
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:31,180
These were my neighbors,

726
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,849
they knew me.

727
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:34,934
Very normal men.

728
00:47:51,869 --> 00:47:55,413
We got him in Yemen, Pakistan, Russia,
all over. He used several passports.

729
00:47:55,497 --> 00:47:58,374
Okay, but did they put him and
the nuclear material together at any time?

730
00:47:58,458 --> 00:48:01,127
lt's only circumstantial. The Russians
don't know exactly how much. . .

731
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:05,131
lf he did have 1 5, 1 8 pounds of it,
how did he transport it internationally?

732
00:48:05,215 --> 00:48:06,215
He had lots of money.

733
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,801
Once it's properly sealed,
it's not that hard to move.

734
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:10,386
Anything new on the ex-wife?

735
00:48:10,470 --> 00:48:13,055
Yeah, we tracked her to Oregon.
She used an ATM in Eugene.

736
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,474
Local PD's hardcore on all motels
and B and Bs.

737
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,726
We'll get her within the next 1 2 hours.

738
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:19,270
Vince, Younger was arrested in a mall.
There must be a tape.

739
00:48:19,354 --> 00:48:22,565
The Military lntel has it. They're working out
whether we're allowed to see it.

740
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,775
-Oh, Jesus.
-Boss, check it out.

741
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:27,904
l got a Hertz employee in Jersey
who lD'd him. lt's a definite lD.

742
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:29,947
He rented a two-ton truck,
he never returned it.

743
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:31,490
Great. Trace its movements.

744
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:34,160
Put a want on it to
all law enforcement agencies in major cities.

745
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:36,287
Find someone who's seen that truck.

746
00:48:38,790 --> 00:48:41,918
Okay, he was arrested here.
That means he went cross-country.

747
00:48:42,002 --> 00:48:44,420
Three bombs. One East Coast.
Got to be Manhattan.

748
00:48:44,504 --> 00:48:48,090
One West Coast. Probably LA.
Jesus, we're right in the blast zone.

749
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:51,761
Okay, third one, somewhere in the middle.
Maybe Chicago.

750
00:48:51,845 --> 00:48:52,803
Texas?

751
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:55,640
-Okay, focus on these locations first.
-Doing it now.

752
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:58,267
Hey, Brody, H wants you.

753
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,361
Tell him l'm here.

754
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,404
He can come out.

755
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:14,033
H, she'd like you to come out.

756
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:18,663
Helen, could you come in here?

757
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,415
Please?

758
00:49:25,420 --> 00:49:26,837
Just here.

759
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:31,384
Sorry.

760
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:34,887
Yusuf, it's Thursday.

761
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,265
What will happen today?

762
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,101
Look at her, Yusuf.

763
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:48,192
You know anything about massage?
lt would be very helpful.

764
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:51,988
What? No, not for me, for him.

765
00:49:52,072 --> 00:49:56,617
His neck is in spasm and he needs a break.

766
00:49:56,702 --> 00:49:57,910
Please.

767
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,756
Mind if l play some music?

768
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,435
Like one of these? Keep you going.

769
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,773
Just in case, for later.

770
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,611
Go as deep as you can,
he's blocking the pain,

771
00:50:32,696 --> 00:50:34,405
l don't want him to lose sensation right. . .

772
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,323
No, don't stop.

773
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,420
Some subjects can take it from a male.

774
00:50:50,464 --> 00:50:51,714
Female?

775
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:54,759
Breaks them right down.

776
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:58,054
l had a nurse who used to assist me.

777
00:50:58,805 --> 00:51:01,182
She was very good.

778
00:51:01,266 --> 00:51:03,142
lt's why l married her.

779
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,896
Did Rina tell you
what happened to her family?

780
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,648
Yeah, of course she did.

781
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:14,612
She tells complete strangers sometimes.
lt's embarrassing.

782
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,657
Did she tell you the end of the story?

783
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:21,494
What happened
when they took the village back

784
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,704
and captured the three men?

785
00:51:24,498 --> 00:51:27,833
She killed their wives and kids
in front of them.

786
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:31,962
And just as our troops arrived,
she killed those three men.

787
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:36,759
They arrested her, handed her over to me.

788
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:45,184
Did l tell you our children
were born prematurely, Helen?

789
00:51:46,394 --> 00:51:48,145
We were so worried.

790
00:51:48,855 --> 00:51:52,274
Childbirth was the most beautiful thing.

791
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:59,281
When the tops of their heads start to crown,

792
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:02,076
it's almost as if God actually exists.

793
00:52:05,705 --> 00:52:07,498
How about you, Yusuf?

794
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:11,210
Where you there
when your wife gave birth to Ali?

795
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,381
How about Samura?

796
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:19,802
Agent Brody here would say yes
because she thinks you're a good father.

797
00:52:21,054 --> 00:52:25,683
Me? l don't think you were
anywhere near that hospital.

798
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:33,107
Yes.

799
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:36,610
Yes! That's what l want to see.

800
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:40,656
No, don't! H, don't! Stop!

801
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:41,782
Stop him, please!

802
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,994
l can stop him, but you have to talk to me.
Tell me something !

803
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:48,247
Okay! l'll talk, l'll talk! l'll talk! l'll. . .

804
00:52:59,384 --> 00:53:00,926
l am now willing

805
00:53:04,890 --> 00:53:07,558
to make a statement of my terms.

806
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:13,522
This is a waste of time.

807
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,859
Put him in front of a camera, he gets a break,
that's what he needs.

808
00:53:16,943 --> 00:53:19,737
Now make us an offer, we'll consider it.
More time.

809
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:22,364
lf he talks at all, that's progress.

810
00:53:22,449 --> 00:53:23,866
And we don't make deals with terrorists.

811
00:53:23,950 --> 00:53:27,077
Oh, please, we do it all the time.

812
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:29,330
He'll say he's been tortured, we'll deny it.

813
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:31,582
He'll say he wants a broadcast,
we'll refuse it.

814
00:53:31,666 --> 00:53:35,461
He'll make crazy demands, and we'll reject it.
What's the goddamn point?

815
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:36,879
Sir, we're recording.

816
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:40,925
Mr. President,

817
00:53:43,637 --> 00:53:47,765
l am currently being held
on charges of terrorism.

818
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:56,232
l am a Muslim and a loyal American.

819
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,818
l love my wife.

820
00:54:05,158 --> 00:54:06,700
l love my kids.

821
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,454
l love my country.

822
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:16,418
Since my capture, l have been treated well

823
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:21,006
by the honorable men and women
of our armed forces and police.

824
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:22,258
He's stalling.

825
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,637
l do not require you
to broadcast this statement.

826
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:29,556
That would set a dangerous precedent.

827
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:34,103
l've placed three bombs
in three American cities.

828
00:54:35,230 --> 00:54:37,982
I wiII reveaI their Iocations

829
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:41,193
when you make
the following public announcements.

830
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:43,946
First,

831
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:48,993
no further financial or military support
will be given

832
00:54:49,077 --> 00:54:53,580
to puppet regimes and dictatorships
in any lslamic nations.

833
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,583
Second,

834
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:02,715
that all U.S. forces will be withdrawn
from all lslamic countries.

835
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:08,971
l am willing to accept
a reasonabIe timeframe for these demands.

836
00:55:10,390 --> 00:55:13,559
Mr. President, l know you want to bring
our men and women home

837
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:15,519
to the nation we love.

838
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,191
Thank you

839
00:55:21,276 --> 00:55:23,777
and Allah bless America.

840
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:33,996
Some kind of fucking joke.

841
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:36,665
What if we persuade him that we're willing
to work toward his objectives?

842
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,334
We could get the locations of the bombs.

843
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:42,504
And allow a lone terrorist
to dictate U.S. foreign policy?

844
00:55:42,589 --> 00:55:46,091
He didn't ask for a broadcast.
He didn't ask us to show it to the public.

845
00:55:46,176 --> 00:55:47,343
He just wants to negotiate.

846
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:49,511
Oh, negotiate. Are you out of your mind?

847
00:55:49,596 --> 00:55:53,182
lf we release this to the public, he knows
that we could never make a deal with him.

848
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:56,727
-He just wants to negotiate.
-Just take the deal !

849
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,521
His requests are reasonable, achievable,

850
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,565
and l believe the American people
would go along with them.

851
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:04,276
Which is why you can be damn sure
they won't ever get to hear them.

852
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:06,779
Well, maybe they should.
What are you afraid of?

853
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:09,948
He didn't ask us to do anything.
He just asked the President to announce it.

854
00:56:10,033 --> 00:56:11,617
Might save a few million people.

855
00:56:11,701 --> 00:56:14,286
We've got 21 hours left.
We're running out of time.

856
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,205
lt's what he wants.

857
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:19,625
And he's gathering his strength.
Bargaining for time.

858
00:56:19,709 --> 00:56:21,627
lf you don't cut this deal,

859
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,254
l may have to crank this up a notch or two.

860
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:28,634
To what? What's a notch or two
beyond what you're already doing?

861
00:56:29,803 --> 00:56:32,388
What are you getting by torturing him?

862
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:35,599
He's given us nothing.
We've played right into his hands.

863
00:56:35,683 --> 00:56:37,726
Someone's gonna have to make a call here.

864
00:56:37,811 --> 00:56:39,770
The call is this,

865
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:42,272
l'm not phoning upstairs
to tell the President he has to change

866
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:46,819
a century's worth of Middle East policy
because some asshole made a video.

867
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,823
You haven't even figured out
if the bombs are real !

868
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,533
Okay then.

869
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,494
Pending further developments,
we can assume

870
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:58,080
that the current open protocols
of interrogation continue

871
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,624
until otherwise directed by higher authority.

872
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:04,628
So, in other words,
you want me to go on my way

873
00:57:04,712 --> 00:57:08,132
without telling me to go on my way?

874
00:57:17,892 --> 00:57:22,438
Yusuf, you could make a deal.
You've got these guys cold.

875
00:57:22,522 --> 00:57:25,941
They can't take you to court, they can't
prosecute a man with no fingernails.

876
00:57:26,025 --> 00:57:28,610
Give us your accomplices,
tell us where the bombs are,

877
00:57:28,695 --> 00:57:30,612
we put you on a flight to Pakistan.

878
00:57:30,697 --> 00:57:33,031
-With my kids?
-They'll negotiate.

879
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:36,285
No one outside knows this ever happened.

880
00:57:36,369 --> 00:57:39,913
Give us the bombs and you could be free.

881
00:57:39,998 --> 00:57:42,040
He doesn't want to be free.

882
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,625
Everyone wants to be free.

883
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:47,087
An assumption the U.S. has screwed up
all over the world.

884
00:57:47,172 --> 00:57:50,799
What you call freedom is a false God.

885
00:57:50,884 --> 00:57:53,218
See? Like minds.

886
00:57:53,303 --> 00:57:55,220
Don't you get it, Brody?

887
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:57,598
He placed himself here.

888
00:57:57,682 --> 00:57:59,808
He knew what we'd do to him.

889
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:03,562
Yusuf, tell me where the bombs are.

890
00:58:03,646 --> 00:58:04,938
Make the deal.

891
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:07,524
The bombs

892
00:58:07,609 --> 00:58:11,028
will explode if my terms are not met.

893
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:13,322
But they will be.

894
00:58:13,406 --> 00:58:17,159
No other choice.
You have to tell them that, Brody.

895
00:58:19,913 --> 00:58:22,331
You really don't want to be here for this.

896
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,429
How long does he stand there?

897
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:38,764
23 minutes.

898
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:41,141
Security told the cops,
they came in and got him.

899
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,559
Speed it up, can you?

900
00:58:46,314 --> 00:58:47,606
Zoom in.

901
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:51,527
He walks in, he stands
directly in front of a security camera,

902
00:58:51,611 --> 00:58:54,321
and he stays there for 23 minutes
until he gets caught?

903
00:58:54,405 --> 00:58:57,157
Same day he sent in the tape.
He wanted to get caught.

904
00:58:57,242 --> 00:59:01,453
He let himself get captured
even though he knew we could torture him.

905
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,163
He was prepared for it.

906
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,958
"l'm all prepared," that's what he said.

907
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:08,794
Goddamn it!

908
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,380
He's making monkeys out of us, people.

909
00:59:11,464 --> 00:59:15,759
He rented a truck.
That's loose circumstantial evidence at best.

910
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:19,513
We have no direct evidence
that he even possesses nuclear material.

911
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:21,473
Except a video with three bombs on it.

912
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,559
And he knows how to make those bombs
look just right, doesn't he?

913
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:27,771
He had the time, the means, the capability,
the finance, the contacts.

914
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,231
There's the lranian connection.

915
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:34,278
Some asshole waves a toy gun in the air
and forces the cops to shoot him.

916
00:59:34,362 --> 00:59:37,864
Suicide by police.
How about torture by government?

917
00:59:37,949 --> 00:59:40,492
You're saying he wanted to get captured
so we could torture him?

918
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:41,577
Just to make a point.

919
00:59:41,661 --> 00:59:43,412
Well, what if it is a hoax?

920
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:47,332
He could ask for anything
and we'd have no way of finding out.

921
00:59:47,834 --> 00:59:51,837
Brody, you better get back in there. Now.

922
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:05,434
You can leave him.

923
01:00:05,518 --> 01:00:07,853
l've been ordered to take over.

924
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,689
Okay, Alvarez.

925
01:00:20,199 --> 01:00:21,783
He's all yours.

926
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:34,338
We know, Yusuf.

927
01:00:36,716 --> 01:00:38,717
We know about the bombs.

928
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:42,387
You're very skillful.

929
01:00:43,014 --> 01:00:45,599
You can fake a nuke in a video, right?

930
01:00:47,226 --> 01:00:49,603
-The bombs are real.
-All right.

931
01:00:49,687 --> 01:00:52,147
Then give me one.

932
01:00:52,231 --> 01:00:54,066
Come on, prove it.

933
01:00:55,068 --> 01:00:56,693
Just give me one.

934
01:00:59,072 --> 01:01:01,323
You don't want me to give you proof.

935
01:01:01,407 --> 01:01:03,408
Nobody believes you, Yusuf.

936
01:01:04,118 --> 01:01:08,664
They're only doing this crap
because they want your accomplices.

937
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,916
-What's she doing?
-But l don't even think they exist.

938
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,000
You'll see.

939
01:01:12,085 --> 01:01:14,044
Don't ask me for proof.

940
01:01:14,128 --> 01:01:18,256
We need it in order to believe
the bombs are real.

941
01:01:20,760 --> 01:01:23,095
They'll give you what you want.

942
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,264
You'll be such a hero.

943
01:01:31,479 --> 01:01:33,438
Your wife will come back,

944
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:35,899
your children will love you.

945
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:41,697
You let yourself be captured.

946
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:45,158
You knew what they might do to you,
and they did it.

947
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:51,748
Can't you see that you've already won?

948
01:01:51,833 --> 01:01:57,337
You've proved that we are exactly
the kind of people we say we aren't.

949
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,799
Look what they did to you.

950
01:02:02,135 --> 01:02:04,469
You are the bravest man l know.

951
01:02:05,138 --> 01:02:06,805
But it's over now.

952
01:02:07,640 --> 01:02:08,682
There's no proof.

953
01:02:11,310 --> 01:02:13,395
There are no bombs, are there?

954
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,782
No. No, there never were.

955
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:31,663
There are no bombs.

956
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,875
l just want my wife

957
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:37,377
and my kids.

958
01:02:38,713 --> 01:02:41,423
Please, there are no bombs!

959
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:45,469
Why did you let him keep on?
You could have told me at any time.

960
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,347
l fucked up so bad.

961
01:02:50,224 --> 01:02:51,558
My wife,

962
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:56,813
my religion, my country.

963
01:02:56,898 --> 01:02:58,064
l'm so sorry.

964
01:02:58,149 --> 01:03:00,650
Did you have nuclear material at any time?

965
01:03:00,735 --> 01:03:04,362
Nothing. The bombs are empty shells,
there's nothing in them.

966
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,864
Where did you make the video?

967
01:03:07,700 --> 01:03:09,242
No, l don't want them to hear.

968
01:03:11,204 --> 01:03:13,246
Just whisper it in my ear.

969
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:20,253
ls that right?

970
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:27,344
Please don't let him hurt me anymore.
Please? Please, please.

971
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,235
lt's a hoax.

972
01:03:44,278 --> 01:03:45,570
l knew it was a hoax.

973
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,280
The man has been tortured.

974
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:50,659
l was leading with my questioning.
He would say just about anything right now.

975
01:03:50,743 --> 01:03:52,619
She's right, you know.

976
01:03:53,579 --> 01:03:55,831
We always knew
it was only a one percent chance

977
01:03:55,915 --> 01:03:57,332
anyone could ever pull
something like this off.

978
01:03:57,416 --> 01:03:58,416
We've got an address.

979
01:03:58,501 --> 01:04:01,461
He said something
was going to happen today.

980
01:04:02,088 --> 01:04:03,588
We need to take that seriously.

981
01:04:25,403 --> 01:04:27,445
-Okay, go, now.
-Let's move.

982
01:04:27,613 --> 01:04:30,031
l'm Special Agent Brody.
This is Special Agent Vincent.

983
01:04:30,116 --> 01:04:31,741
-Major Pierce.
-What do you got?

984
01:04:31,826 --> 01:04:34,870
Not much. EOD is inside now,
checking for booby traps,

985
01:04:34,954 --> 01:04:37,539
doing environmental monitoring.
Looking for a source.

986
01:04:37,623 --> 01:04:38,957
Let's go.

987
01:04:42,128 --> 01:04:45,213
Helen, if this is a hoax,
then we're all off the hook.

988
01:04:45,298 --> 01:04:47,883
Something's not right, Vince.

989
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,843
He planned all of this.

990
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,977
Hand me the printout.

991
01:05:02,815 --> 01:05:04,149
This one.

992
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:07,903
lt's the same, l'm sure.

993
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:10,322
Has this area been cleared yet?

994
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:12,991
Oh, shit.

995
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,076
Pierce?

996
01:05:15,661 --> 01:05:20,498
We have a possible location, second floor,
southwestern corner.

997
01:05:21,667 --> 01:05:24,044
Send a team immediately, please.

998
01:05:24,128 --> 01:05:25,712
On our way, copy that.

999
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,132
God, this whole area
could be booby trapped.

1000
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:36,765
Stay there! Don't move!

1001
01:05:40,519 --> 01:05:42,479
Sir, we found something on the roof.

1002
01:05:50,071 --> 01:05:51,237
Vince.

1003
01:05:56,535 --> 01:05:58,620
He wants us up here.

1004
01:05:58,704 --> 01:05:59,913
Why?

1005
01:06:06,837 --> 01:06:07,837
What the hell is this?

1006
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:09,547
Don't touch that!

1007
01:06:10,049 --> 01:06:11,049
Shit.

1008
01:06:21,435 --> 01:06:24,854
Experts on the scene think that a bomb
probably made from C4 plastic explosives

1009
01:06:24,939 --> 01:06:28,024
has been deliberately detonated
in a downtown shopping mall.

1010
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:30,151
They did not rule out terrorism.

1011
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:33,822
So far, we've seen several bodies come out.
They wouldn't give us a count.

1012
01:06:33,906 --> 01:06:36,950
l got no idea
how many casualties we've got in there,

1013
01:06:38,411 --> 01:06:40,912
but there are badly injured people.

1014
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:44,040
People are screaming for help.

1015
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:46,042
The whole building, it just blew up.

1016
01:06:53,634 --> 01:06:55,176
You stupid son-of-a-bitch.

1017
01:06:55,261 --> 01:06:59,264
Okay, okay! lmagine what
three goddamn nukes would do!

1018
01:07:03,769 --> 01:07:05,603
How could you do this?

1019
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:06,855
How could you?

1020
01:07:06,939 --> 01:07:08,565
You wanted proof,

1021
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:12,235
l needed a break. l can hold out now.

1022
01:07:12,319 --> 01:07:16,531
lt was a shopping mall !
Fifty-three people are dead !

1023
01:07:16,615 --> 01:07:20,452
That was your fault.
God loves them, they're martyrs, all martyrs.

1024
01:07:20,536 --> 01:07:23,705
Fifty-three of them.
Fifty-three bodies blown to pieces!

1025
01:07:23,789 --> 01:07:24,873
-Don't do it, Brody.
-Shut up!

1026
01:07:24,957 --> 01:07:27,167
-Don't.
-Where are those bombs?

1027
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:28,877
Where are those fucking bombs?

1028
01:07:28,961 --> 01:07:30,754
Do it! Do it!

1029
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:34,424
l love my country, you people crap on it!

1030
01:07:34,508 --> 01:07:38,344
l love my religion and you people spit on it!

1031
01:07:38,429 --> 01:07:42,557
Just remember something,
l'm here because l want to be here!

1032
01:07:42,641 --> 01:07:46,561
l let myself be caught
because l'm not a coward.

1033
01:07:46,645 --> 01:07:51,316
l chose to meet my oppressors face to face!

1034
01:07:52,651 --> 01:07:55,653
You call me a barbarian.

1035
01:07:56,322 --> 01:07:57,572
Then what are you?

1036
01:07:57,656 --> 01:08:01,242
What, you expect me to weep
over 50 civilians?

1037
01:08:01,327 --> 01:08:04,704
You people kill that number every day!

1038
01:08:04,789 --> 01:08:09,793
How does it feel, Brody?
This is not about me. This is about you !

1039
01:08:09,877 --> 01:08:14,589
How does it feel?
You have no authority here! None!

1040
01:08:14,757 --> 01:08:18,760
There is but one authority and it is not you !

1041
01:08:18,844 --> 01:08:20,345
You are a blight!

1042
01:08:20,429 --> 01:08:22,931
You are a cancer!

1043
01:08:23,015 --> 01:08:24,974
How does it feel, Brody?

1044
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:38,363
What's going on, Helen?

1045
01:08:39,907 --> 01:08:42,534
Do you want me to take that?

1046
01:09:02,346 --> 01:09:05,056
Boss, Younger got a parking ticket in Dallas.

1047
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:08,143
They traced the address
to a derelict warehouse. They found a bomb.

1048
01:09:08,227 --> 01:09:09,477
They think it's real. lt's nuclear.

1049
01:09:09,562 --> 01:09:12,897
lt may contain four, four and a half pounds,
set to detonate Friday at noon.

1050
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:14,524
lt was well hidden, perfectly shielded.

1051
01:09:14,608 --> 01:09:16,734
We got real lucky,
but there's less than three hours left.

1052
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:18,236
Airborne detection came up empty.

1053
01:09:18,320 --> 01:09:19,904
There's almost no chance
to find the other two in time.

1054
01:09:19,989 --> 01:09:24,701
Brody? l need you to come in,
he's in a state.

1055
01:09:24,785 --> 01:09:26,452
Of course he's in a state.
He's being tortured to death.

1056
01:09:26,537 --> 01:09:28,788
Not Younger, H. He wants you.

1057
01:09:49,268 --> 01:09:50,727
He might not crack.

1058
01:09:52,271 --> 01:09:53,313
What are you saying?

1059
01:09:55,024 --> 01:09:56,441
He might not crack.

1060
01:09:56,525 --> 01:09:57,984
There's only three hours left.

1061
01:10:01,822 --> 01:10:04,782
Look, ten million people are about to die.

1062
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,868
Are you still in, or not?

1063
01:10:20,841 --> 01:10:23,801
lf you tell me to stop, l will.

1064
01:10:24,970 --> 01:10:26,304
l'll stop.

1065
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,515
Yes.

1066
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,936
Brody, they got Jehan Younger.

1067
01:11:18,774 --> 01:11:22,068
Where are my children?
l want to see them right now.

1068
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:23,778
They're in protective custody.
Please calm down.

1069
01:11:23,862 --> 01:11:27,615
Don't tell me to calm down.
l want my children !

1070
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,826
Mrs. Younger, please take a seat
and we'll talk about this.

1071
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:33,204
l am not saying a word to you
until you let me see my kids!

1072
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:35,873
Mrs. Younger,
you are in very serious trouble.

1073
01:11:35,958 --> 01:11:39,544
You'll be charged with supporting terrorism
if you do not cooperate with us immediately.

1074
01:11:39,628 --> 01:11:41,087
That is a life sentence.

1075
01:11:41,171 --> 01:11:44,465
Your children will be put in foster care
and you will never see them again.

1076
01:11:44,550 --> 01:11:48,136
Now, sit the fuck down
and start telling us what you know.

1077
01:11:48,220 --> 01:11:50,138
Brody, come out here, please.

1078
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:01,316
-l'm taking her in there with him.
-What?

1079
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:04,485
The wife is our ace in the hole.
You can talk to him now, get some answers.

1080
01:12:04,570 --> 01:12:05,653
But we haven't interrogated her.

1081
01:12:05,738 --> 01:12:06,863
She could tell us where the bombs are.

1082
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:10,658
We don't have time. We have to take her
in there, question her and him.

1083
01:12:10,743 --> 01:12:14,037
But we have to do it right
and we got to do it now.

1084
01:12:21,795 --> 01:12:23,880
What are you doing to me?

1085
01:12:25,257 --> 01:12:26,924
What kind of animals are you?

1086
01:12:27,009 --> 01:12:29,135
You saw the tape. We didn't make it, he did.

1087
01:12:29,219 --> 01:12:30,803
He's a liar, he would never do that.

1088
01:12:30,888 --> 01:12:32,847
lt's real and we think you're in on it.

1089
01:12:32,931 --> 01:12:34,474
Do you ever want to
see your children again?

1090
01:12:34,558 --> 01:12:36,017
l never knew anything about this.

1091
01:12:36,101 --> 01:12:39,145
We don't believe you, Jehan.
Tell us something.

1092
01:12:51,617 --> 01:12:53,326
Jehan.

1093
01:12:53,410 --> 01:12:55,411
What have you done to him?

1094
01:12:57,873 --> 01:12:59,415
You pigs.

1095
01:12:59,500 --> 01:13:03,211
Now, Jehan, for your sake and ours,

1096
01:13:03,295 --> 01:13:06,631
l want you to ask him where the bombs are.

1097
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:11,719
Say, "Yusuf, please tell me
where the bombs are, darling?"

1098
01:13:13,639 --> 01:13:15,473
-Say it!
-Yusuf,

1099
01:13:16,725 --> 01:13:19,102
where are the bombs?

1100
01:13:19,186 --> 01:13:21,729
l think she still loves you, Yusuf.

1101
01:13:21,814 --> 01:13:24,190
She wants to save you.

1102
01:13:24,274 --> 01:13:26,901
Tell him. Tell him you love him.

1103
01:13:30,906 --> 01:13:32,782
l love you, Yusuf.

1104
01:13:34,785 --> 01:13:37,328
This is what you wanted, Yusuf.

1105
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:39,914
What you wanted !

1106
01:13:42,334 --> 01:13:46,671
So, now l'm gonna cut some little pieces off
Jehan and give them to you.

1107
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:48,464
-Oh, no.
-No.

1108
01:13:48,549 --> 01:13:50,091
-What the hell are you doing?
-Alvarez, hold the chair.

1109
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:52,009
-No, please.
-H, you can't do this!

1110
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,887
Please, stop him ! Please!
l'm an American citizen !

1111
01:13:54,972 --> 01:13:56,597
-H.
-Shut up, Charlie.

1112
01:13:56,682 --> 01:13:59,559
We're not gonna let you do this.
lt's not just me now.

1113
01:13:59,643 --> 01:14:02,353
Oh, so now you're all working against me?

1114
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:07,108
Do you want to know where the bombs are
or not? lt's my responsibility!

1115
01:14:07,192 --> 01:14:08,818
You want me to win,
or you want him to win?

1116
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:10,319
H, put the knife down.

1117
01:14:10,404 --> 01:14:12,989
So you made a choice, you want him to win?

1118
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:14,949
You're all so fucking selfish.

1119
01:14:15,033 --> 01:14:17,618
This is not about you !

1120
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:20,663
This is war. This is sacrifice.

1121
01:14:22,499 --> 01:14:23,833
Take her back.

1122
01:14:26,962 --> 01:14:28,379
No!

1123
01:14:31,425 --> 01:14:33,301
-There's no time!
-No! Jehan !

1124
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:34,510
There's no time!

1125
01:14:34,595 --> 01:14:36,137
No!

1126
01:14:36,221 --> 01:14:38,473
There's no time!

1127
01:15:04,082 --> 01:15:05,082
H.

1128
01:15:12,257 --> 01:15:14,133
Government officials in each city

1129
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:20,515
are currently being evacuated
to nuclear shelters.

1130
01:15:23,268 --> 01:15:25,728
Our own families have already gone.

1131
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:31,567
Bound to be some rumors, panic.

1132
01:15:36,156 --> 01:15:38,282
We need you to finish this.

1133
01:16:24,663 --> 01:16:27,707
You're gonna die here today.

1134
01:16:27,791 --> 01:16:29,625
You know that, right?

1135
01:16:31,628 --> 01:16:33,671
We both know it.

1136
01:16:35,173 --> 01:16:37,258
They won't stop me now.

1137
01:16:38,343 --> 01:16:40,011
There's no limits.

1138
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,210
What are you doing?

1139
01:17:14,588 --> 01:17:16,130
He needs a little break.

1140
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:18,716
For God's sake, we have no time.

1141
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:21,636
Well, what do you think l should do, Helen?

1142
01:17:21,720 --> 01:17:24,013
You son-of-a-bitch.
What do you want me to say?

1143
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,599
Just do what you have to do!

1144
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,606
What l have to do, Agent Brody, is

1145
01:17:37,569 --> 01:17:39,070
unthinkable.

1146
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:46,619
Bring me the children.

1147
01:17:46,703 --> 01:17:48,162
Jesus.

1148
01:17:48,246 --> 01:17:52,583
Give me the children, l'll give you
the answers you want. Just bring them in.

1149
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,460
l'm not doing that.

1150
01:17:54,544 --> 01:17:57,171
Just let him see them.
Let him see them with me.

1151
01:17:57,255 --> 01:17:58,255
No.

1152
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,091
Over my dead body.

1153
01:18:00,175 --> 01:18:01,801
-Kids are right outside.
-No!

1154
01:18:01,885 --> 01:18:04,345
-You just don't get it, do you?
-You're not gonna hurt those children.

1155
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:05,429
-Do you think l would?
-Yes!

1156
01:18:05,514 --> 01:18:06,889
Good ! Then so will he.

1157
01:18:06,973 --> 01:18:10,351
lt's all been leading up to this.
He has to believe H will do anything.

1158
01:18:10,435 --> 01:18:13,062
Look, all you have to do is bring them in,

1159
01:18:13,146 --> 01:18:15,648
take them in the room and strap them down.
That's it.

1160
01:18:15,732 --> 01:18:19,360
-No.
-l won't harm them. l give you my word.

1161
01:18:19,444 --> 01:18:20,861
But he has to believe l will.

1162
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:24,865
Then he will tell us anything we want,
all right?

1163
01:18:25,242 --> 01:18:27,284
All right, l'll do it.

1164
01:18:27,619 --> 01:18:29,954
lf you hurt those children, l will kill you.

1165
01:18:30,038 --> 01:18:31,539
Fine, Agent Brody.

1166
01:18:31,623 --> 01:18:34,125
That's if we don't all die
from an explosion first.

1167
01:18:34,918 --> 01:18:36,252
Jesus, fuck it.

1168
01:19:02,446 --> 01:19:04,196
Come on, this way.

1169
01:19:11,329 --> 01:19:12,705
You ready, Yusuf?

1170
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:14,915
Gonna keep you safe.

1171
01:19:15,000 --> 01:19:17,251
This is the end.

1172
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:21,088
Nothing l do to you could make you talk.

1173
01:19:21,173 --> 01:19:22,173
Not now.

1174
01:19:34,853 --> 01:19:36,729
Look at your children.

1175
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:39,440
Aren't you proud of them?

1176
01:19:44,029 --> 01:19:45,196
Don't.

1177
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:47,948
Don't let him do it, don't let him, l beg you.

1178
01:19:48,033 --> 01:19:50,367
Yusuf. Yusuf, talk to us.

1179
01:19:51,870 --> 01:19:54,538
You leave my fucking babies alone.

1180
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,040
Talk to us, Yusuf.

1181
01:19:59,461 --> 01:20:00,461
No!

1182
01:20:04,883 --> 01:20:08,385
Fuck! You fuck! You fuck!

1183
01:20:11,181 --> 01:20:12,473
New York! There's a bomb in New York!

1184
01:20:12,557 --> 01:20:14,058
Where in New York? Give me an address.

1185
01:20:14,142 --> 01:20:15,476
Fuck you ! Stop him !

1186
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:18,896
-Get him away from my fucking babies!
-Give me an address!

1187
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:21,106
701 West 83rd, second floor!

1188
01:20:21,191 --> 01:20:22,399
-Stop him !
-Second one?

1189
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,860
-Fucking stop him now!
-Give me the second one!

1190
01:20:24,945 --> 01:20:29,782
Los Angeles, 1 8750 Centinela,
garage underneath it! Fucking stop him !

1191
01:20:29,866 --> 01:20:31,575
Give me the third one!
We don't fucking believe you, Yusuf!

1192
01:20:31,660 --> 01:20:35,496
Fuck! Please! l beg you, please stop him !

1193
01:20:35,747 --> 01:20:37,289
Give me the third one, Yusuf.

1194
01:20:37,374 --> 01:20:40,835
Dallas. Basement, 1 533 Smith.
Don't let him hurt them, please!

1195
01:20:40,919 --> 01:20:41,919
Dallas, basement.

1196
01:20:42,003 --> 01:20:43,128
Please, please don't let him
hurt them. Please.

1197
01:20:44,589 --> 01:20:46,590
H, he told us. He told us where they are.

1198
01:20:47,425 --> 01:20:49,343
-He's lying.
-No, he's not!

1199
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:51,971
The bomb we already found in Dallas.
He gave the right address.

1200
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,764
How long before you verify the others?

1201
01:20:54,266 --> 01:20:56,642
-Twenty.
-Twenty minutes.

1202
01:20:56,726 --> 01:20:58,310
Well, l have 20 minutes with them then.

1203
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:01,605
"We will assume that the current methods
of interrogation will continue

1204
01:21:01,731 --> 01:21:03,983
"unless otherwise directed
by a higher authority."

1205
01:21:04,276 --> 01:21:06,527
He sounds serious. He can't be serious?

1206
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:08,779
H, this operation is terminated !

1207
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:11,740
None of you respect my work, do you?

1208
01:21:11,825 --> 01:21:16,954
None of you understand!
We don't stop until this all checks out!

1209
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:18,873
-Shit.
-That's the ruIe!

1210
01:21:18,957 --> 01:21:21,709
lt's my duty to continue!

1211
01:21:21,793 --> 01:21:22,960
H?

1212
01:21:23,044 --> 01:21:25,212
They're children, innocent children !

1213
01:21:25,297 --> 01:21:29,508
There are no innocent children !
Not his children anyway.

1214
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:34,680
Too selfish and weak
to carry out his own plan? No.

1215
01:21:34,764 --> 01:21:38,893
No, l don't think so. l don't believe it!
Not from him.

1216
01:21:38,977 --> 01:21:41,145
No! Stop him ! Please!

1217
01:21:41,229 --> 01:21:43,647
Yusuf! There's more, isn't there?

1218
01:21:43,732 --> 01:21:44,857
No, no, no!

1219
01:21:44,941 --> 01:21:46,817
Do you believe l can do this?

1220
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:49,069
H, he believes it! He believes it!

1221
01:21:49,154 --> 01:21:51,405
Faith is not enough, he has to know it.

1222
01:21:51,489 --> 01:21:52,489
He knows it!

1223
01:21:52,574 --> 01:21:55,826
Knowing it is not enough, he has to see it.

1224
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,578
No! Get him out of there!

1225
01:21:57,662 --> 01:22:01,999
All right, that's enough ! Winston,
get over here and blow that goddamn door!

1226
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:03,083
Clear the door!

1227
01:22:05,503 --> 01:22:06,962
Check, check!

1228
01:22:07,047 --> 01:22:08,756
Goddamn it! Take it out!

1229
01:22:10,216 --> 01:22:11,383
Check!

1230
01:22:12,344 --> 01:22:13,385
Move it!

1231
01:22:13,470 --> 01:22:15,346
H ! Stand down ! Stand down !

1232
01:22:20,727 --> 01:22:22,811
All right, that's enough. That's enough !

1233
01:22:24,814 --> 01:22:28,776
-Get the medic!
-No! Get them out of here!

1234
01:22:28,860 --> 01:22:31,612
No one else sees them, you understand me?
Nobody sees them !

1235
01:22:31,696 --> 01:22:33,948
What's the matter with you?

1236
01:22:34,032 --> 01:22:36,033
Get up! Get up!

1237
01:22:41,873 --> 01:22:43,040
You knew.

1238
01:22:43,124 --> 01:22:44,124
You knew he could do this.

1239
01:22:44,209 --> 01:22:47,252
-You had those kids lined up for him !
-l didn't know he'd go crazy!

1240
01:22:56,763 --> 01:22:59,974
That man over there killed 53 people.

1241
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:03,435
Some of them women and children,
and yet somehow l'm the villain?

1242
01:23:03,520 --> 01:23:06,480
You keep your mouth shut, you maniac.
You're fucking evil !

1243
01:23:06,564 --> 01:23:07,690
Oh, and he's not?

1244
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:15,155
You hear that, Yusuf?

1245
01:23:15,240 --> 01:23:16,907
You win.

1246
01:23:16,992 --> 01:23:20,077
You got them all on your side now.

1247
01:23:20,161 --> 01:23:21,745
You're in the clear.

1248
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:26,542
You don't even have to tell them
about the fourth bomb.

1249
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,423
What do you mean?

1250
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:33,966
Don't you know him by now?

1251
01:23:34,050 --> 01:23:36,677
He's planned this every step of the way.

1252
01:23:36,761 --> 01:23:38,804
l mean, what if he couldn't hold out?

1253
01:23:38,888 --> 01:23:41,056
All he's got to do
is give us the three bombs, right?

1254
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:48,397
Now l remember 1 5 to 1 8 pounds
of nuclear material missing.

1255
01:23:50,608 --> 01:23:51,984
Can't you fucking count?

1256
01:23:53,194 --> 01:23:58,907
Four and a half times three is 1 3 and a half,
times four is 1 8.

1257
01:24:00,618 --> 01:24:02,411
Give you three guesses what he did.

1258
01:24:03,079 --> 01:24:04,913
-Ask him.
-You think there's another bomb?

1259
01:24:04,998 --> 01:24:08,250
Course there's another bomb.
There's always another bomb.

1260
01:24:08,334 --> 01:24:11,754
He didn't tell you about the mall bomb.
But he gave you the other three.

1261
01:24:12,964 --> 01:24:15,799
Yes, Agent Brody, there's a fourth bomb.

1262
01:24:16,760 --> 01:24:19,011
Oh, Christ! Get those kids back in here.

1263
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:22,890
lf anyone tries to stop you, shoot him.
That is a direct order!

1264
01:24:22,974 --> 01:24:24,391
No. No bomb.

1265
01:24:24,476 --> 01:24:25,809
We can't do this.

1266
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:29,229
-Brody, if there's a one percent chance. . .
-He's a maniac,

1267
01:24:29,314 --> 01:24:32,316
you just said so! We have no evidence.

1268
01:24:32,400 --> 01:24:34,276
But if we did it would be all right. Right?

1269
01:24:34,360 --> 01:24:36,320
You'll get the children back.

1270
01:24:36,446 --> 01:24:38,030
Really?
And what shall l do with them this time?

1271
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:40,157
-How far can l go?
-Just do the job, H.

1272
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:44,703
l have a condition.

1273
01:24:45,538 --> 01:24:47,498
You. You go out there

1274
01:24:47,582 --> 01:24:51,085
and drag those kids back in here kicking,
screaming and begging.

1275
01:24:51,169 --> 01:24:53,587
You take them in there
and strap them down,

1276
01:24:53,671 --> 01:24:56,673
'cause you're the only person here
with any decency.

1277
01:24:56,758 --> 01:25:01,095
Fuck Alvarez, fuck Charlie.
Fuck all the rest of these fucks.

1278
01:25:01,179 --> 01:25:03,305
-You do it.
-Why me?

1279
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:06,600
'Cause if you can do it, then anybody can.

1280
01:25:08,061 --> 01:25:10,062
H, there is no time for games.

1281
01:25:10,146 --> 01:25:11,772
l'm not playing games.

1282
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,274
l need your help.

1283
01:25:15,276 --> 01:25:17,694
Tell me l can do this.

1284
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:21,115
Brody, this is his two kids
against thousands of ours.

1285
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,450
Justify me,

1286
01:25:23,535 --> 01:25:24,785
tell me it's okay.

1287
01:25:24,869 --> 01:25:26,703
-lf there's another bomb out there. . .
-You can't do this!

1288
01:25:26,788 --> 01:25:28,747
We're fucking human beings.

1289
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:32,042
Let the bomb go off! We cannot do this!

1290
01:25:41,845 --> 01:25:43,095
That's it.

1291
01:25:50,728 --> 01:25:52,104
You're a free man, Yusuf.

1292
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:55,274
They can't prosecute
a man with no fingernails.

1293
01:25:55,358 --> 01:25:56,525
What the hell are you doing?

1294
01:25:56,609 --> 01:25:58,944
This is it. l'm letting him go.

1295
01:26:00,029 --> 01:26:01,655
We're done here.

1296
01:26:06,119 --> 01:26:07,995
We're not finished.

1297
01:26:08,079 --> 01:26:10,330
Where are those fucking kids?

1298
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,249
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

1299
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,794
Who's gonna do your dirty work for you?
You gonna do it yourself?

1300
01:26:15,879 --> 01:26:18,422
You don't think l have that covered?

1301
01:26:18,756 --> 01:26:21,258
We have your children, H.

1302
01:26:21,885 --> 01:26:22,926
Do you understand?

1303
01:26:23,511 --> 01:26:26,430
-Just get back to it. Right now!
-We need to calm down, okay?

1304
01:26:27,098 --> 01:26:28,098
Shit.

1305
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,685
Put your fucking weapon down
or l'll fucking shoot you.

1306
01:26:31,769 --> 01:26:35,189
No, don't shoot him. Don't shoot him !
lf he dies, we're screwed.

1307
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:36,648
Yusuf, put that gun down.

1308
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:38,942
Yusuf!

1309
01:26:44,449 --> 01:26:45,490
lt's okay.

1310
01:26:51,289 --> 01:26:53,290
Everything's gonna be okay.

1311
01:26:54,584 --> 01:26:57,294
Please look after my children.

1312
01:26:57,962 --> 01:26:59,046
-Jesus.
-No.

1313
01:27:16,397 --> 01:27:18,023
We've done all we can.

1314
01:27:20,777 --> 01:27:22,611
Let's just hope.

1315
01:27:24,948 --> 01:27:26,782
We'll know soon enough.

1316
01:27:31,329 --> 01:27:33,080
Been nice working with you, Agent Brody.

1317
01:27:45,343 --> 01:27:47,177
This never happened.

1318
01:27:48,137 --> 01:27:49,471
They never existed.

1319
01:27:49,555 --> 01:27:54,226
Younger, the children, none of them.

1320
01:28:43,568 --> 01:28:46,695
1 8570 CentineIa. That's the address.
We got it in sight.

1321
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:50,574
Location has been confirmed. You are a go.

1322
01:28:52,577 --> 01:28:54,202
Get bomb disposal !

1323
01:28:54,287 --> 01:28:56,705
We're at the northeast corner
of the building. We've located the device.

1324
01:28:56,789 --> 01:28:57,873
Copy that.

1325
01:28:58,916 --> 01:29:01,084
All right, stand clear and make room.

1326
01:29:01,419 --> 01:29:03,503
Bomb disposal, you are clear at the scene.

1327
01:29:27,028 --> 01:29:28,028
We're good.

1328
01:29:28,112 --> 01:29:31,073
The bomb is disarmed.
l repeat, the bomb is disarmed.

1329
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,746
Congratulations, Major.
