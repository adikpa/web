00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,875
Hassan, I am not.

166
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,542
I want to save my people.

167
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,167
I want to save you.

168
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:08,333
Get lost.

169
00:15:24,042 --> 00:15:25,208
The package is safe.

170
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:50,625
Understand?

171
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,750
Hamid, Mukhriz, quickly.

172
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,125
<i>Hello, all call sign.</i>

173
00:16:13,208 --> 00:16:14,833
Good job, everyone.

174
00:16:14,917 --> 00:16:17,917
Return to base now, out.

175
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:35,333
MALBATT BASE

176
00:17:40,417 --> 00:17:42,875
LCPL. WAHID, REAR SHOOTER,
COMBAT TEAM CHARLIE, CALL SIGN 21C

177
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:43,958
Here.

178
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,125
Get ready.

179
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,208
Is everything okay?

180
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,583
All right, nice ball.

181
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,833
- Goal!
- Goal!

182
00:17:53,917 --> 00:17:55,750
- One more time.
- Goal!

183
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:58,917
Ninety-five.

184
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,167
Ninety-six.

185
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:01,375
Ninety-seven.

186
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,542
{\an8}I only asked for 100
and you're already like this.

187
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,333
{\an8}-You can't even do 100?
- 99,

188
00:18:06,417 --> 00:18:08,000
{\an8}-I cannot do anymore.
- 100.

189
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:09,708
Push! You can.

190
00:18:09,792 --> 00:18:10,792
I can't!

191
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:14,208
- You can.
- I can't anymore.

192
00:18:19,917 --> 00:18:23,625
What's wrong with you?

193
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,833
Don't talk about faith.

194
00:18:24,917 --> 00:18:25,976
Giving me your feet is not funny.

195
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,601
I didn't give you my feet.
I gave you my socks.

196
00:18:27,625 --> 00:18:29,425
You said you wanted
to make the country proud.

197
00:18:29,458 --> 00:18:31,042
You can't even make us proud.

198
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,646
Do you want to make the country proud?

199
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,000
Wash your socks first.

200
00:18:34,792 --> 00:18:37,167
It smells like
a lizard's carcass, you know?

201
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:42,417
Can you move aside?

202
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,380
You think because you're big,
I'm scared of you?

203
00:18:44,417 --> 00:18:45,851
I didn't do anything.
What's wrong with you?

204
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,000
CPL. ASLAM, APC COMMANDER

205
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:48,542
Your chest is jiggling.

206
00:18:52,292 --> 00:18:53,875
- Abdalle.
- Zul, come play with us.

207
00:18:55,042 --> 00:18:56,125
Ramlee.

208
00:19:58,375 --> 00:20:00,875
- "Tight face," say it.
- "Tight face."

209
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,292
- Tight.
- You play too much, bro.

210
00:20:22,417 --> 00:20:23,937
- Peace be upon you.
- Peace be upon you.

211
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,708
<i>Oh, Fatimah</i>

212
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:29,000
We have received a call from UNOSOM.

213
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:33,167
They thanked MALBATT's assault team

214
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,458
for successfully rescuing
all the hostages.

215
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,833
The CNN also expressed
their utmost gratitude

216
00:20:38,917 --> 00:20:40,333
for rescuing them.

217
00:20:41,583 --> 00:20:44,708
But you have one complaint.

218
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:48,042
There is a complaint
that our attack method

219
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,167
on the Grand Suite is too extreme.

220
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,333
- They could've been killed...
- But sir.

221
00:20:52,917 --> 00:20:54,417
In an urgent situation like that,

222
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,667
that was the only way we had, sir.

223
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,833
Before more Somalis come to attack us...

224
00:20:58,917 --> 00:21:02,042
I know you've done your best.

225
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:04,583
A few minutes of delay

226
00:21:04,667 --> 00:21:06,292
might have caused more casualties.

227
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,208
Nobody is blaming you.

228
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:10,625
You are only following orders

229
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,667
and orders are orders.

230
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,167
Let us settle this one.

231
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,292
You may go now.

232
00:21:19,792 --> 00:21:21,333
Thank you, sir.

233
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,500
{\an8}It's actually good
that someone complained.

234
00:21:27,583 --> 00:21:28,625
{\an8}Why is that?

235
00:21:29,917 --> 00:21:31,042
Only then will they know

236
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:33,500
Malaysia can also perform rescue missions,

237
00:21:33,583 --> 00:21:35,667
not just America.

238
00:21:37,792 --> 00:21:39,393
PVT. ISA, APC DRIVER,
COMBAT TEAM CHARLIE, CALL SIGN 12C

239
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:42,042
Sounds like fun over there, darling.

240
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,667
Who else came to the house?

241
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,333
Mak Jah is coming in a bit.

242
00:21:45,417 --> 00:21:46,875
She's sending over porridge.

243
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:49,000
Don't worry.

244
00:21:49,083 --> 00:21:51,417
Many people can take care of me here.

245
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:57,167
Do you still keep the photo

246
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,792
in your shirt pocket?

247
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,958
Like you always tell me.

248
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,250
<i>Until forever, dear.</i>

249
00:22:03,333 --> 00:22:05,083
Until forever.

250
00:22:06,375 --> 00:22:07,667
Okay, darling.

251
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,083
Peace be upon you.

252
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:10,625
Peace be upon you too.

253
00:22:13,958 --> 00:22:15,250
Is anybody there?

254
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:17,458
I feel like I'm playing alone.

255
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:20,625
{\an8}Look, I'll teach you how to fold.

256
00:22:20,708 --> 00:22:21,708
Go high.

257
00:22:23,167 --> 00:22:24,208
Hurry, skipper.

258
00:22:24,958 --> 00:22:26,250
Okay, high ball.

259
00:22:26,333 --> 00:22:28,667
Go high like the KOMTAR Building.

260
00:22:31,375 --> 00:22:34,167
What's wrong with you guys?
Can't you see people are walking here?

261
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,958
- Does it hurt?
- Pity the kid.

262
00:22:36,042 --> 00:22:38,458
If you don't know how to play, don't play.

263
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:41,833
Brother, come.

264
00:22:42,792 --> 00:22:44,417
What's with the gloomy face?

265
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,167
We're only joking.

266
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:47,500
Whose photo is that?

267
00:22:47,583 --> 00:22:48,583
Your wife?

268
00:22:48,625 --> 00:22:49,667
Corporal.

269
00:22:50,625 --> 00:22:51,958
Mind your own business.

270
00:22:52,042 --> 00:22:53,208
Why are you so arrogant?

271
00:22:53,292 --> 00:22:54,292
Enough.

272
00:22:54,375 --> 00:22:55,458
Let's go.

273
00:22:55,542 --> 00:22:57,125
Come and join us.

274
00:22:57,208 --> 00:22:58,809
Sitting by yourself,
you'll make yourself gloomier

275
00:22:58,833 --> 00:22:59,958
and become dumber. Come.

276
00:23:00,042 --> 00:23:01,500
It's okay, Corporal. I'm fine.

277
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:03,875
- Thank you.
- It's not okay.

278
00:23:03,958 --> 00:23:06,208
Come over.
We'll teach you to become stronger.

279
00:23:06,292 --> 00:23:07,917
You have to be a bit braver, right?

280
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,375
- Like…
- Like you?

281
00:23:10,667 --> 00:23:11,875
Sir.

282
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:16,333
Have you been to war?

283
00:23:16,417 --> 00:23:17,542
- Never, sir.
- Never, sir.

284
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,708
If you've only gone for recces in town,

285
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:22,625
there is no need to show off.

286
00:23:22,708 --> 00:23:24,125
It's really quite embarrassing.

287
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,042
Then you have the nerve to bully

288
00:23:27,125 --> 00:23:28,458
like regular crooks.

289
00:23:29,042 --> 00:23:30,542
Are you soldiers or school kids?

290
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,083
- Soldiers, sir!
- Soldiers, sir!

291
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,542
Are you okay, Isa?

292
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,958
I'm okay, sir.

293
00:23:42,708 --> 00:23:44,042
Thank you, sir!

294
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,375
At ease.

295
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,250
This kid, I swear.

296
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,708
Was that bullying?

297
00:24:02,792 --> 00:24:03,625
- Bullying?
- No.

298
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:04,625
- No, right?
- No.

299
00:24:04,708 --> 00:24:05,917
- This is bullying.
- Hey!

300
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,667
- Kids nowadays!
- You…

301
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:08,958
So sensitive!

302
00:24:09,042 --> 00:24:10,208
Lee. Zul.

303
00:24:10,292 --> 00:24:11,542
Hurry up and play.

304
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:12,875
What are you waiting for?

305
00:24:18,792 --> 00:24:20,625
Talking about girls…

306
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:32,208
What are you waiting for?

307
00:24:32,292 --> 00:24:33,976
Don't tell me you need me
to teach you that.

308
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,750
{\an8}Hey, where are you guys going?

309
00:24:35,833 --> 00:24:38,125
{\an8}Hey! You left us for women.

310
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:58,630
- Peace be upon you, sir.
- Peace be upon you too.

311
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,500
Sir.

312
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,583
Osman.

313
00:25:05,667 --> 00:25:07,750
I have just received a call
from Colonel Ward,

314
00:25:07,833 --> 00:25:10,542
Operations Colonel from the US Army
at the UNOSOM HQ.

315
00:25:11,125 --> 00:25:12,375
Sounds important, sir.

316
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,583
In wartime,
even unimportant things can be important.

317
00:25:15,667 --> 00:25:16,667
Sir.

318
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:17,833
But don't worry.

319
00:25:17,917 --> 00:25:20,125
I think this mission
is just a regular one.

320
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:21,833
So according to Colonel Ward,

321
00:25:21,917 --> 00:25:24,250
Somali terrorists will attack New Port

322
00:25:24,917 --> 00:25:26,208
at 17:00 today.

323
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:28,892
So they are asking for assistance
to strengthen the security force

324
00:25:28,917 --> 00:25:29,750
at New Port.

325
00:25:29,833 --> 00:25:30,833
So I suggest

326
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,792
you bring Bravo Company with you.

327
00:25:32,875 --> 00:25:34,976
If I'm not mistaken,
Alpha Company has a mission tomorrow.

328
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,667
Yes, sir. I will inform Adnan
to prepare his men.

329
00:25:37,750 --> 00:25:39,125
Any questions?

330
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,583
This is just a regular mission right, sir?

331
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:44,750
Yes, I am sure of it.

332
00:25:44,792 --> 00:25:46,393
There will be no terrorist attack
this afternoon.

333
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,250
Anyway, those Somali terrorists

334
00:25:48,333 --> 00:25:49,750
won't be so crazy to attack now

335
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:51,583
when they see our security forces.

336
00:25:51,667 --> 00:25:52,500
Yes, sir.

337
00:25:52,583 --> 00:25:53,875
Thank you, sir.

338
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,250
I'm the same.

339
00:26:01,333 --> 00:26:03,042
I don't know either.

340
00:26:04,125 --> 00:26:06,208
While I was on the recce just now,

341
00:26:06,292 --> 00:26:08,708
I saw some Somalis
who weren't all that happy with us.

342
00:26:08,792 --> 00:26:10,083
Who cares about them?

343
00:26:10,167 --> 00:26:11,875
We're doing our jobs, right?

344
00:26:11,958 --> 00:26:13,292
No, I mean.

345
00:26:13,375 --> 00:26:14,708
What are we doing here?

346
00:26:15,792 --> 00:26:17,875
It's like we're supporting America,

347
00:26:17,958 --> 00:26:19,708
but they don't even know Malaysia.

348
00:26:19,792 --> 00:26:21,917
I had to explain, you know?

349
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,042
Thailand. Singapore.

350
00:26:24,125 --> 00:26:25,750
We're here in the middle, Malaysia.

351
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,500
It's to that extent.

352
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,333
Meanwhile, the Somalis look at us

353
00:26:29,417 --> 00:26:31,250
as if we're traitors of our faith.

354
00:26:31,333 --> 00:26:32,917
What's our story, actually?

355
00:26:33,583 --> 00:26:34,958
Traitors of our faith?

356
00:26:35,833 --> 00:26:38,917
Doing good doesn't take into account
of what your religion is, Mail.

357
00:26:39,542 --> 00:26:41,042
Let me ask you,

358
00:26:41,125 --> 00:26:43,708
does Islam teach us to let people starve?

359
00:26:43,792 --> 00:26:44,792
No.

360
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:47,333
Has Islam taught us
to capture innocent people?

361
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:49,125
- No.
- No, Mail.

362
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,167
So when we get orders,

363
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,333
we just do our jobs.

364
00:26:53,417 --> 00:26:55,458
Let the Commander worry about the rest.

365
00:26:55,542 --> 00:26:57,333
Goodness.

366
00:26:57,958 --> 00:27:00,792
Busy fighting wars outside,
busy discussing inside.

367
00:27:00,875 --> 00:27:02,196
LT. JOHAN, COMMANDER OF PLATOON 3

368
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,208
Dahari, you were so lucky yesterday.

369
00:27:04,292 --> 00:27:05,958
You got to go on the rescue mission.

370
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,833
Where's the luck?

371
00:27:07,917 --> 00:27:09,583
That's lucky. Why is that not lucky?

372
00:27:09,667 --> 00:27:11,833
From the time I arrived until now,
it's always recce.

373
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:12,958
It's boring.

374
00:27:13,042 --> 00:27:14,962
What am I going to tell
the people of Alor Gajah?

375
00:27:15,625 --> 00:27:17,768
I can't say I went on walks here.
I'm not a tour guide.

376
00:27:17,792 --> 00:27:19,750
I want to tell
some war stories too, right?

377
00:27:19,833 --> 00:27:21,167
Go and request it then.

378
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:23,583
I'm not asking for a full-on war.

379
00:27:23,667 --> 00:27:25,083
A little action is all.

380
00:27:25,875 --> 00:27:26,792
Sir.

381
00:27:26,875 --> 00:27:28,792
Bravo Company order for standby now, sir.

382
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:30,333
For a new mission, sir.

383
00:27:30,417 --> 00:27:31,292
- Now?
- Yes, sir.

384
00:27:31,375 --> 00:27:32,250
All right, thank you.

385
00:27:32,333 --> 00:27:33,726
It's always Bravo. It's never-ending.

386
00:27:33,750 --> 00:27:35,500
What about Alpha?

387
00:27:35,583 --> 00:27:38,542
They are really playing favorites.

388
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:43,083
Hey, don't leave.

389
00:27:43,167 --> 00:27:45,083
If you leave, I'll be very sad, you know?

390
00:27:45,167 --> 00:27:46,875
Who am I going to flirt with here?

391
00:28:07,208 --> 00:28:08,917
Goodness, your eyes are so beautiful.

392
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,208
Yes, I know. It's blue.

393
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,500
I seek forgiveness from God.

394
00:29:32,208 --> 00:29:33,625
Take this.

395
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:35,125
<i>Attention Bravo Company.</i>

396
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:37,417
<i>Special Operation Warrant.</i>

397
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:40,917
<i>No movements before 16:00C.</i>

398
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:43,750
<i>Be ready for combat, RV in the New Port.</i>

399
00:29:43,833 --> 00:29:45,917
<i>Command will be delivered in the RV.</i>

400
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:46,875
<i>Action.</i>

401
00:29:46,958 --> 00:29:48,167
- Move!
- Move!

402
00:30:01,083 --> 00:30:02,542
<i>0 Bravo.</i>

403
00:30:02,625 --> 00:30:04,667
<i>We've lived in this war for some time now.</i>

404
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,625
<i>In war,</i>

405
00:30:06,708 --> 00:30:08,125
<i>nobody wins,</i>

406
00:30:08,625 --> 00:30:09,917
<i>everybody loses.</i>

407
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,458
<i>Over.</i>

408
00:30:11,542 --> 00:30:13,208
29, question.

409
00:30:13,292 --> 00:30:15,000
Why so serious?

410
00:30:15,083 --> 00:30:18,333
I thought
it was just a regular mission, over.

411
00:30:18,417 --> 00:30:19,708
Just felt like talking.

412
00:30:20,417 --> 00:30:22,333
We see the same things every day.

413
00:30:23,042 --> 00:30:24,125
Operations Officer.

414
00:30:24,708 --> 00:30:26,542
0 Bravo wait, out.

415
00:30:26,625 --> 00:30:28,583
Has Bravo Company reached New Port?

416
00:30:28,667 --> 00:30:29,583
Not yet, sir.

417
00:30:29,667 --> 00:30:31,333
<i>We've just received new orders.</i>

418
00:30:36,125 --> 00:30:39,958
9, keep heading towards New Port

419
00:30:40,042 --> 00:30:41,583
<i>and wait there.</i>

420
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:44,958
Call sign 1 will move in a while,

421
00:30:45,042 --> 00:30:48,583
together with the US and Pakistan, over.

422
00:30:48,667 --> 00:30:50,500
29, roger that.

423
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:52,000
Question.

424
00:30:52,083 --> 00:30:54,792
What is our latest mission? Over.

425
00:30:54,875 --> 00:30:58,292
9, I'm not sure myself.

426
00:30:58,375 --> 00:31:00,125
<i>So don't go anywhere.</i>

427
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:03,500
<i>0 Bravo will join you there.</i>

428
00:31:03,583 --> 00:31:07,625
Wait until we receive
the next bit of intel.

429
00:31:07,708 --> 00:31:08,833
<i>Over.</i>

430
00:31:54,208 --> 00:31:56,958
- Move!
- Move now!

431
00:31:58,417 --> 00:31:59,417
Faster.

432
00:32:03,042 --> 00:32:04,875
Corporal, why so many rounds of bullets?

433
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:05,958
Major's orders.

434
00:32:08,375 --> 00:32:10,958
Now this is what you call a war.

435
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:27,375
{\an8}UNOSOM BASE

436
00:33:10,833 --> 00:33:12,542
Do you guys want to hear?

437
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:13,708
My new joke.

438
00:33:17,292 --> 00:33:18,292
Mus.

439
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,208
I haven't received any information.

440
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:33,583
According to Colonel Rahman,

441
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:37,042
the US military and the Pakistani military
will come here

442
00:33:37,125 --> 00:33:38,875
for a briefing on the mission.

443
00:33:38,958 --> 00:33:42,292
We will probably enter
the territory of Farrah Aidid's followers.

444
00:33:42,375 --> 00:33:44,833
But sir, we've never been there.

445
00:33:44,917 --> 00:33:46,101
That's dangerous territory, sir.

446
00:33:46,125 --> 00:33:47,958
I need to remind you

447
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:49,833
that the place has no protection.

448
00:33:49,917 --> 00:33:51,875
We can be attacked
by the enemy at any time.

449
00:33:51,958 --> 00:33:53,417
Remember our training.

450
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,625
The most important thing

451
00:33:54,708 --> 00:33:56,417
is to take care of your team members.

452
00:33:57,417 --> 00:34:00,208
In this job,
you're always confronted by death.

453
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,125
But if we do it together,

454
00:34:03,708 --> 00:34:06,417
if God wills, He will be with us.

455
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:09,708
Sir, from 9.

456
00:34:11,792 --> 00:34:14,625
<i>91, this is 9, over.</i>

457
00:34:14,708 --> 00:34:16,708
91 copy, over.

458
00:34:16,792 --> 00:34:19,167
<i>9, they have arrived, out.</i>

459
00:34:20,833 --> 00:34:21,833
They are here.

460
00:37:27,875 --> 00:37:32,000
91, we're not taxis. You can't do this.

461
00:37:32,083 --> 00:37:34,625
The US Army is not proficient
at using APC.

462
00:37:34,708 --> 00:37:37,542
<i>Our APC will be damaged, over.</i>

463
00:37:37,625 --> 00:37:41,708
9, Major Osman, calm down.

464
00:37:41,792 --> 00:37:44,583
MALBATT talked it over with UNOSOM HQ.

465
00:37:44,667 --> 00:37:47,583
<i>MALBATT will bring the commander,</i>

466
00:37:47,667 --> 00:37:51,583
rear gunner,
and a driver for every APC, over.

467
00:37:51,667 --> 00:37:53,417
91, question.

468
00:37:53,917 --> 00:37:55,667
Our assault troop, over.

469
00:37:55,750 --> 00:37:58,542
9, we have done our best.

470
00:37:58,625 --> 00:38:00,292
Orders are orders.

471
00:38:00,875 --> 00:38:03,250
<i>We have to carry on with this mission.</i>

472
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:04,333
<i>Out.</i>

473
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:16,708
Lee, why just the assault team?

474
00:38:17,583 --> 00:38:19,250
Because of orders.

475
00:38:20,292 --> 00:38:22,292
Sir, this is unfair.

476
00:38:22,375 --> 00:38:23,292
We have a right

477
00:38:23,375 --> 00:38:25,042
- to follow this mission, sir.
- Hamid.

478
00:38:25,125 --> 00:38:27,250
Sir, please talk to them.

479
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:29,833
If they want to use our APC,

480
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:31,833
they have to take us along.

481
00:38:31,917 --> 00:38:33,667
Or we won't follow, sir.

482
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,625
Calm down, this is an order.

483
00:38:36,292 --> 00:38:39,292
You yourself said we are better
than these white soldiers.

484
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:40,917
- We can help!
- Hamid.

485
00:38:46,458 --> 00:38:47,500
Rude.

486
00:38:48,083 --> 00:38:49,167
Hamid!

487
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:51,625
Calm down.

488
00:38:52,792 --> 00:38:55,667
Sir, we want to follow this mission.

489
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:57,875
We really want to follow this mission.

490
00:38:57,958 --> 00:39:00,417
What are we lacking, sir?

491
00:39:00,500 --> 00:39:03,417
This is why the Somalis call us traitors.

492
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:06,542
Because we just do
what the white soldiers tell us like cows.

493
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:08,875
Hamid, do you realize
who you're talking to?

494
00:39:09,625 --> 00:39:11,125
Respect, Hamid.

495
00:39:11,208 --> 00:39:12,292
Respect.

496
00:39:13,417 --> 00:39:16,083
This mission is not for you
to show who is greater.

497
00:39:17,625 --> 00:39:19,167
Who do you think you are?

498
00:39:19,250 --> 00:39:21,333
Every little thing must involve you.

499
00:39:21,417 --> 00:39:22,583
God?

500
00:39:25,750 --> 00:39:27,000
Colonel Rahman has tried.

501
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:28,583
Understand this?

502
00:39:29,375 --> 00:39:30,917
Orders are orders.

503
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:38,750
You can all return to base.

504
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:40,875
I will return to base with them

505
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,625
to further observe this mission.

506
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:45,792
All decisions are not mine anymore.

507
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,375
Everything is up to you.

508
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,500
Dismissed.

509
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:53,208
Rank.

510
00:39:53,875 --> 00:39:55,917
Attention.

511
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,083
Get in.

512
00:41:57,917 --> 00:41:59,333
I'll be all right.

513
00:42:25,917 --> 00:42:28,875
My first time out of the village
and I'm at a place like this.

514
00:42:29,417 --> 00:42:31,583
I haven't even been to Kuala Lumpur.

515
00:42:32,167 --> 00:42:34,250
Isa, it won't be long.

516
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:36,208
In two or three hours, we can go back.

517
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:38,125
{\an8}COMBAT TEAM ALPHA, CALL SIGN 21A,
ON THE WAY TO OBJECTIVE A

518
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,250
Why are they stopping?

519
00:44:48,542 --> 00:44:51,500
- Hello, 29. This is 21.
- Sir.

520
00:44:51,583 --> 00:44:54,000
<i>Pakistan's tank has stopped, over.</i>

521
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,500
29 wait, out.

522
00:44:57,458 --> 00:45:00,351
{\an8}Sir, Pakistan is withdrawing because
they don't have night vision goggles.

523
00:45:00,375 --> 00:45:02,083
{\an8}They don't dare to proceed.

524
00:45:05,042 --> 00:45:07,083
19, that's ridiculous.

525
00:45:07,167 --> 00:45:10,208
It's not like Pakistan
has never fought at night, over.

526
00:45:10,292 --> 00:45:13,125
29, do we proceed, Mad?

527
00:45:13,208 --> 00:45:15,583
Pakistan is not going to help, over.

528
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:18,208
19, we have no choice.

529
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:20,667
<i>Orders are orders, over.</i>

530
00:45:20,750 --> 00:45:22,875
29, I know, Mad.

531
00:45:22,958 --> 00:45:25,833
But even a big country like that
is leaving, over.

532
00:45:25,917 --> 00:45:29,333
Nan, you saw just now during the briefing.

533
00:45:29,417 --> 00:45:31,375
How the white soldiers looked at us.

534
00:45:31,458 --> 00:45:34,125
They're ridiculous.
They don't even know where Malaysia is.

535
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:37,917
Nan.

536
00:45:39,417 --> 00:45:40,708
Why are we here?

537
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:44,625
Sir.

538
00:45:45,708 --> 00:45:48,167
Colonel Lawrence wants us
to carry on with the mission.

539
00:45:52,542 --> 00:45:55,042
Tell him we'll go in right now.

540
00:45:57,125 --> 00:46:01,417
{\an8}Hello, 21. This is 29,
overtake the Pakistan tank.

541
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,167
{\an8}Advance forward
then go right towards Objective A.

542
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,042
{\an8}Move now, out.

543
00:46:42,167 --> 00:46:43,792
What's this?

544
00:46:44,333 --> 00:46:45,833
If you want to leave, just leave.

545
00:46:45,917 --> 00:46:47,833
What are you doing here?

546
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,583
Shoot them.

547
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:27,833
Damn it, go back to your country.

548
00:47:29,625 --> 00:47:30,833
Shoot them.

549
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:35,292
I can't see anything.

550
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,667
Shoot them, shoot the APC.

551
00:47:43,833 --> 00:47:46,667
Pok Nik! Are you okay?

552
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,292
- Okay. Are you okay?
- Okay.

553
00:47:49,375 --> 00:47:51,583
Shoot them.

554
00:48:00,958 --> 00:48:03,458
Lee, I can't see anything.

555
00:48:03,542 --> 00:48:04,875
What are you talking about?

556
00:48:04,958 --> 00:48:07,125
You still can't see
with such a wide windscreen.

557
00:48:07,208 --> 00:48:09,375
How can I see? It's dark.

558
00:48:09,458 --> 00:48:11,583
My windscreen is full of bullets.

559
00:48:11,667 --> 00:48:12,917
Totally blind.

560
00:48:14,875 --> 00:48:16,667
Pok Nik, take care of this for a while.

561
00:48:16,750 --> 00:48:17,917
They knew we were coming.

562
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,333
They were ready for us.

563
00:48:20,083 --> 00:48:22,792
Lee, I have a bad feeling.

564
00:48:23,917 --> 00:48:25,000
Good.

565
00:48:25,750 --> 00:48:28,125
That bad feeling is part of our job.

566
00:48:29,667 --> 00:48:31,375
Okay. What now?

567
00:48:38,583 --> 00:48:40,042
What are they doing?

568
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:41,833
Why aren't we moving yet?

569
00:48:42,667 --> 00:48:45,625
<i>Hello, 21. This is 21 Alpha.</i>

570
00:48:45,708 --> 00:48:47,292
We have passed the Pakistani tank,

571
00:48:47,375 --> 00:48:50,250
but we are receiving contact
of heavy attacks.

572
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:52,542
What are your next orders? Over.

573
00:48:53,083 --> 00:48:56,125
21, we are trapped behind the tank.

574
00:48:56,208 --> 00:48:58,458
Head straight and then turn right.

575
00:48:58,542 --> 00:49:01,250
<i>Head straight and then turn right, over.</i>

576
00:49:01,333 --> 00:49:05,542
21 Alpha, left or right? Over.

577
00:49:05,625 --> 00:49:07,708
{\an8}21, go right.

578
00:49:07,792 --> 00:49:10,375
{\an8}Don't go left, go right.

579
00:49:10,458 --> 00:49:12,750
<i>Right now, out.</i>

580
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:16,958
Zul, just take the next right ahead. Now.

581
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:38,500
Aim the tire.

582
00:49:43,917 --> 00:49:46,083
Lee, our tire is damaged.

583
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:47,583
What should we do?

584
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,708
You want to go out and change the tire?

585
00:49:51,208 --> 00:49:52,875
Just go!

586
00:49:52,958 --> 00:49:55,958
Just go straight
and turn right at the front there.

587
00:50:00,042 --> 00:50:03,042
- Hey!
- Lee, I can't go right.

588
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:04,208
There's a barricade.

589
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:07,000
The order is to turn right,
so just turn right.

590
00:50:07,083 --> 00:50:09,167
I can't go in. There's a barricade.

591
00:50:09,875 --> 00:50:11,500
Do it until you can.

592
00:50:11,583 --> 00:50:13,375
Do it until you can!

593
00:50:39,667 --> 00:50:41,292
Do it until you can, Zul!

594
00:51:01,417 --> 00:51:05,208
Pok Nik, why so quiet at the back?
Shoot at them!

595
00:51:05,292 --> 00:51:07,250
Ask these white soldiers to help

596
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,000
instead of just staring into space!

597
00:51:34,542 --> 00:51:35,625
Shoot them.

598
00:51:39,458 --> 00:51:41,708
- Give it to me. Quick.
- Okay.

599
00:51:43,750 --> 00:51:45,083
Zul!

600
00:51:47,917 --> 00:51:49,667
Goodness, this is bad.

601
00:51:49,750 --> 00:51:52,250
Zul, move forward a little bit more.

602
00:51:52,333 --> 00:51:54,875
- There's a junction to the right, take it.
- Okay.

603
00:52:06,833 --> 00:52:09,250
Lee, there's a barrier here too.

604
00:52:09,333 --> 00:52:11,958
You go ahead and see
if there are other junctions up front.

605
00:52:15,083 --> 00:52:16,417
Load the RPG and shoot them.

606
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,417
RPG ahead!

607
00:52:47,583 --> 00:52:51,500
Zul, you just turned left.
You should turn right.

608
00:52:51,583 --> 00:52:53,750
The attack was getting stronger, Lee.

609
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:55,458
I cannot go forward anymore.

610
00:52:55,542 --> 00:52:57,375
I don't want to die here today.

611
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:05,417
Hello, 21. This is 21 Alpha.

612
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,833
We had to go left, over.

613
00:53:08,458 --> 00:53:11,500
Hello, 21. This is 21 Alpha.

614
00:53:11,583 --> 00:53:14,667
We had to go left, over.

615
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:18,292
<i>Hello, 29. This is 21, over.</i>

616
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:19,917
29 send, over.

617
00:53:20,000 --> 00:53:25,833
21, call sign 21 Alpha and 54 Alpha

618
00:53:25,917 --> 00:53:29,083
<i>have passed the tank,</i>

619
00:53:29,167 --> 00:53:30,917
<i>but cannot be contacted.</i>

620
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:34,292
<i>- Cannot be contacted, over.</i>
- Sir.

621
00:53:34,375 --> 00:53:36,375
29 wait, out.

622
00:53:37,250 --> 00:53:38,542
Sir, we have to move now.

623
00:53:38,625 --> 00:53:42,083
- Colonel Lawrence is having a fit.
- He hasn't seen my fit yet! Wait a minute!

624
00:53:45,167 --> 00:53:47,167
Tell him to tell Pakistan

625
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,208
to move all their tanks now.

626
00:53:49,292 --> 00:53:50,375
Yes, sir.

627
00:54:08,917 --> 00:54:12,458
Hello, 21 Alpha. This is 21.

628
00:54:12,542 --> 00:54:16,083
Where are you, Ramlee? Over.

629
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:23,333
Damn it!

630
00:54:23,917 --> 00:54:26,583
{\an8}Hello, 21. This is 21 Alpha.

631
00:54:26,667 --> 00:54:29,500
{\an8}We had to turn left, over.

632
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:35,583
{\an8}21?

633
00:54:37,125 --> 00:54:38,333
{\an8}Nothing heard.

634
00:54:39,375 --> 00:54:40,417
{\an8}Out.

635
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:46,708
We're lost.

636
00:55:01,083 --> 00:55:03,750
Hello, 23. This is 29, over.

637
00:55:04,458 --> 00:55:06,625
23 send, over.

638
00:55:06,708 --> 00:55:10,500
29, call sign 21 is ahead.

639
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:13,125
<i>They receive heavy attacks.</i>

640
00:55:13,208 --> 00:55:14,833
<i>Change the order of march.</i>

641
00:55:14,917 --> 00:55:19,875
<i>You're leading the Alpha convoy now.</i>

642
00:55:19,958 --> 00:55:21,500
Move forward with your platoon

643
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,333
<i>and we will follow from behind.</i>

644
00:55:23,417 --> 00:55:25,917
<i>Be careful there are terrorists everywhere</i>

645
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:28,167
<i>all the way to National Street, out.</i>

646
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,583
Sure, it's a place I'm used to.

647
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:48,583
Sir, how do we go right, sir?

648
00:55:50,958 --> 00:55:55,292
Hello, all call sign 23.

649
00:55:55,375 --> 00:55:58,000
Move towards the junction

650
00:55:58,083 --> 00:56:00,292
<i>and shoot the barricade in front.</i>

651
00:56:00,375 --> 00:56:03,500
<i>Shoot the barricade in front, out.</i>

652
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:40,833
Hello, 29. This is 23.

653
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:42,542
I need to dismount, over.

654
00:56:42,625 --> 00:56:45,792
29 it's dangerous for you, over.

655
00:56:45,875 --> 00:56:49,792
23, I need to dismount
for the mission, out.

656
00:56:49,875 --> 00:56:51,875
Wan, give covering fire.

657
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,083
I'm going out.

658
00:56:53,750 --> 00:56:55,417
Sir, it's dangerous outside.

659
00:57:08,375 --> 00:57:09,458
No, right?

660
00:57:09,542 --> 00:57:10,875
Stupid.

661
00:58:17,958 --> 00:58:18,958
Hurry!

662
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:38,292
Hey!

663
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:39,375
What?

664
00:59:49,542 --> 00:59:51,583
Zul, you stop right ahead.

665
00:59:51,667 --> 00:59:53,625
Our heroes are getting out.

666
01:00:33,333 --> 01:00:37,000
Pok Nik, to your left. Eleven o'clock.

667
01:00:59,875 --> 01:01:02,292
Lee, what are you doing?

668
01:01:06,542 --> 01:01:10,208
- Quick, shoot them.
- Shoot them.

669
01:01:13,083 --> 01:01:16,833
Lee, one o'clock, RPG!

670
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,125
Zul!

671
01:01:32,458 --> 01:01:34,167
What are you doing?

672
01:01:35,292 --> 01:01:36,292
RPG!

673
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:37,500
Zul!

674
01:01:44,667 --> 01:01:46,042
Are you okay?

675
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:09,625
How many times do I have to tell you?

676
01:02:10,250 --> 01:02:13,292
They were aiming at you just now.

677
01:02:13,375 --> 01:02:17,833
01:09C

678
01:02:17,917 --> 01:02:23,750
{\an8}COMBAT TEAM CHARLIE, CALL SIGN 12C,
ON THE WAY TO OBJECTIVE B

679
01:02:38,042 --> 01:02:40,833
Hello, 12. This is 12 Charlie.

680
01:02:40,917 --> 01:02:42,833
<i>Where are we heading now? Over.</i>

681
01:02:42,917 --> 01:02:44,875
12, later at the National Street,

682
01:02:44,958 --> 01:02:48,083
turn left and then head straight
for Objective B, over.

683
01:02:48,167 --> 01:02:50,708
12 Charlie copy, out.

684
01:02:51,500 --> 01:02:53,583

686
01:03:09,083 --> 01:03:10,167
Damn it.

687
01:03:34,792 --> 01:03:35,708
Why did we stop?

688
01:03:35,792 --> 01:03:37,750
Corporal, are we really going to…

689
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:43,542
<i>Hello, 12 Charlie. This is 12.</i>

690
01:03:43,625 --> 01:03:45,750
Did I tell you to stop? Over.

691
01:03:45,833 --> 01:03:49,000
12 Charlie, we have a situation, over.

692
01:04:56,375 --> 01:04:59,125
Hello, 12 Charlie. This is 12.

693
01:04:59,208 --> 01:05:02,208
Scare the boy so that he runs away, hurry.

694
01:05:02,292 --> 01:05:04,042
<i>We are already late, out.</i>

695
01:05:07,458 --> 01:05:09,708
What did they do to this country?

696
01:05:10,458 --> 01:05:12,875
That boy grew up as bold as this.

697
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,583
{\an8}Sir.

698
01:05:52,667 --> 01:05:53,667
{\an8}FORWARD OPERATING BASE

699
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:55,125
{\an8}I'm sorry for being late, sir.

700
01:05:55,208 --> 01:05:57,333
{\an8}Too many attacks from New Port to here.

701
01:05:58,792 --> 01:05:59,875
The Somalis

702
01:05:59,958 --> 01:06:02,333
are really eager for war tonight.

703
01:06:03,375 --> 01:06:04,375
{\an8}Intelligence Officer.

704
01:06:04,458 --> 01:06:06,750
{\an8}CPT. MANSOR, INTELLIGENCE OFFICER

705
01:06:06,833 --> 01:06:08,125
Yes, sir.

706
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:11,500
All right, I was wrong.

707
01:06:11,583 --> 01:06:14,583
Before this, I had assumed
that this was an ordinary operation.

708
01:06:14,667 --> 01:06:17,083
But from my conversation
with UNOSOM just now,

709
01:06:17,167 --> 01:06:19,458
we found out that the US soldiers

710
01:06:19,542 --> 01:06:22,042
have tried to extract their men
four times already

711
01:06:22,125 --> 01:06:23,458
to no avail.

712
01:06:24,292 --> 01:06:25,458
Now,

713
01:06:25,542 --> 01:06:26,708
only us.

714
01:06:26,792 --> 01:06:30,000
Only Malaysia volunteered
for this rescue mission.

715
01:06:30,792 --> 01:06:33,333
Is that why we entered the town
using only one entryway?

716
01:06:34,375 --> 01:06:36,375
Because the other routes are unusable?

717
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:38,500
This operation,
it's a suicide operation, sir.

718
01:06:38,583 --> 01:06:39,625
Operation Officer.

719
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:44,625
What are you talking about?

720
01:06:45,917 --> 01:06:48,458
Don't you have faith
in your men's abilities?

721
01:06:51,042 --> 01:06:54,458
I trust them with my life, sir.

722
01:06:58,333 --> 01:07:00,292
{\an8}01:13C, CALL SIGN 12C

723
01:07:00,375 --> 01:07:02,875
{\an8}Corporal, take a left in another 100 m.

724
01:07:02,958 --> 01:07:04,500
Clear, no barrier.

725
01:07:04,583 --> 01:07:06,042
Okay, Isa. Be careful.

726
01:07:14,542 --> 01:07:16,042
Sir, new information.

727
01:07:16,125 --> 01:07:18,417
There's a group of US soldiers
trapped at crash site 2

728
01:07:18,500 --> 01:07:19,667
waiting for us.

729
01:07:19,750 --> 01:07:21,458
- Do we know their location?
- No, sir.

730
01:07:21,542 --> 01:07:23,500
But Little Bird will show the way.

731
01:07:23,583 --> 01:07:25,167
Copy, I will instruct the others.

732
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,208
12 copy, over.

733
01:07:27,292 --> 01:07:28,833
<i>19, out.</i>

737

738
01:07:37,250 --> 01:07:39,042
Isa, NVG.

739
01:08:09,333 --> 01:08:10,833
Quickly load all the weapons.

740
01:08:10,917 --> 01:08:12,625
Don't let them rescue our enemies.

741
01:08:26,667 --> 01:08:27,667
Sir.

742
01:08:52,292 --> 01:08:54,667
<i>Hello, 12. This is 12 Bravo.</i>

743
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:57,875
<i>A Humvee in the back got destroyed
by a landmine, over.</i>

744
01:08:59,375 --> 01:09:01,458
Hello, 19. This is 12.

745
01:09:04,708 --> 01:09:07,917
19, I haven't heard anything
from the US side.

746
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:09,667
Accomplish the mission, out.

747
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,208
We'll carry on with the mission.

748
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:13,667
What is it now?

749
01:09:30,208 --> 01:09:31,417
RPG.

750
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:00,708
Shoot them.

751
01:10:11,083 --> 01:10:12,167
Isa, are you okay?

752
01:10:13,208 --> 01:10:14,500
Why haven't we moved?

753
01:10:15,458 --> 01:10:17,875
<i>Hello, 12. This is 19.</i>

754
01:10:17,958 --> 01:10:20,750
Find the source of the attacks
and destroy them.

755
01:10:20,833 --> 01:10:23,542
If they shoot down Little Bird,
we are finished.

756
01:10:23,625 --> 01:10:24,625
<i>Out.</i>

757
01:10:31,375 --> 01:10:32,417
Where is it?

758
01:10:36,583 --> 01:10:38,583
How many times do I have to say?

759
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:39,958
Just stay in the APC.

760
01:10:52,333 --> 01:10:53,708
I already told you!

761
01:10:57,917 --> 01:11:00,792
Hello, all call sign 12.

01:11:15,083 --> 01:11:16,333
Damn! Go!

766
01:12:36,417 --> 01:12:38,542
Rear gunner, front building.

Yes, sir.

It's a piece of junk now.

It's okay.
All these white soldiers can help us.

01:24:28,625 --> 01:24:31,125
<i>Our mission is not finished yet, over.</i>

824
01:24:31,208 --> 01:24:32,417
<i>23 Bravo.</i>

825
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:35,708
<i>The US soldiers want to leave now, over.</i>

826
01:24:35,792 --> 01:24:39,250
23, we are instructed
to bring back the US soldiers.

827
01:24:39,333 --> 01:24:41,083
Dead or alive.

828
01:24:41,167 --> 01:24:44,250
<i>Now go back to your position
and sit quietly.</i>

829
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,333
<i>Understand? Out.</i>

830
01:24:47,208 --> 01:24:49,542
04:00C

831
01:24:57,208 --> 01:25:00,375
Lee, no one knows where we are.

832
01:25:01,042 --> 01:25:02,500
Who's going to save us?

833
01:25:06,458 --> 01:25:08,042
I'm also blank right now.

834
01:25:47,917 --> 01:25:50,625
{\an8}Don't you work for the government?
This is what you get?

835
01:26:58,083 --> 01:27:00,000
Lee, we have to go.

836
01:27:38,417 --> 01:27:40,500
Let's go. Hold on for a little bit.

837
01:27:50,792 --> 01:27:53,542
LOST TEAM

838
01:27:55,917 --> 01:27:58,625
OBJECTIVE A

839
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:03,792
OBJECTIVE B

840
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:11,667
{\an8}COMBAT TEAM CHARLIE, CALL SIGN 12

841
01:28:11,750 --> 01:28:16,667
{\an8}OBJECTIVE B

842
01:28:16,750 --> 01:28:18,333
{\an8}<i>Hello, all call sign 1.</i>

843
01:28:18,417 --> 01:28:21,458
{\an8}<i>We have arrived at the dispersal point
for Objective B.</i>

844
01:28:21,542 --> 01:28:24,375
Inform the US soldiers to dismount.

845
01:28:24,458 --> 01:28:25,458
Out.

846
01:28:56,333 --> 01:28:57,625
Isa, standby.

847
01:28:57,708 --> 01:28:59,250
We'll arrive soon. Understand?

848
01:29:00,333 --> 01:29:01,417
Understood, Corporal.

849
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:51,500
{\an8}Darling.

850
01:29:58,875 --> 01:30:00,542
RPG!

851
01:30:19,708 --> 01:30:22,042
Rear gunner, are you all okay at the back?

852
01:30:22,125 --> 01:30:23,375
<i>I'm fine, sir.</i>

853
01:30:38,125 --> 01:30:39,708
Sir, we got hit by a land mine.

854
01:30:39,792 --> 01:30:41,000
The car is destroyed, sir.

855
01:30:41,708 --> 01:30:43,000
At least you're okay.

856
01:30:47,250 --> 01:30:49,458
God is the greatest.

857
01:30:50,333 --> 01:30:52,792
God is the greatest.

858
01:30:59,625 --> 01:31:01,458
Go inside.

859
01:31:02,625 --> 01:31:06,083
God is the greatest.

860
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:11,958
God is the greatest.

861
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:16,167
God is the greatest.

862
01:31:17,542 --> 01:31:19,458
Come to prayer.

863
01:31:20,333 --> 01:31:22,667
Come to prayer.

864
01:31:23,500 --> 01:31:26,250
Come to prayer.

865
01:31:29,125 --> 01:31:32,375
Come to prayer.

866
01:31:32,458 --> 01:31:34,125
God is the greatest.

867
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:37,625
{\an8}Isa. Recite the Shahada, Isa.

868
01:31:37,708 --> 01:31:40,333
Come to prayer.

869
01:31:41,417 --> 01:31:43,750
God is the greatest.

870
01:31:43,833 --> 01:31:44,958
God is the greatest.

871
01:31:45,042 --> 01:31:46,458
{\an8}Isa. Recite the Shahada, Isa.

872
01:31:46,542 --> 01:31:49,958
Isa, wake up!

873
01:31:50,042 --> 01:31:51,042
Isa!

874
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:52,250
God.

875
01:31:53,208 --> 01:31:56,125
I seek forgiveness from God. Isa.

876
01:31:57,042 --> 01:31:58,375
Isa.

877
01:31:59,083 --> 01:32:01,417
God is the greatest.

878
01:32:15,333 --> 01:32:17,958
<i>Hello, 19. This is 12.</i>

879
01:32:18,833 --> 01:32:20,875
<i>Private Isa KIA.</i>

880
01:32:22,750 --> 01:32:23,750
<i>Out.</i>

881
01:32:30,667 --> 01:32:32,476
We have to contact UNOSOM
and ask the Americans

882
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:34,542
to bring the Black Hawk
for CASEVAC now, sir.

883
01:32:34,625 --> 01:32:37,875
I've spoken to them,
but the area is too dangerous.

884
01:32:37,958 --> 01:32:39,792
A lot of choppers were shot down.

885
01:32:39,875 --> 01:32:43,125
Why are the American lives more valuable
than the lives of our men, sir?

886
01:32:43,208 --> 01:32:45,583
Our men know their duty.

887
01:32:46,167 --> 01:32:48,125
Orders are orders!

888
01:32:49,667 --> 01:32:52,042
Have you forgotten your duty,
Operations Officer?

889
01:32:58,292 --> 01:33:00,083
Have faith in orders.

890
01:33:00,167 --> 01:33:02,167
Have faith in our team.

891
01:33:03,375 --> 01:33:06,000
Have faith that we will solve this mission

892
01:33:06,083 --> 01:33:07,542
without further loss of lives.

893
01:33:08,292 --> 01:33:10,458
That's what we should be doing!

894
01:33:20,708 --> 01:33:23,042
To God we belong
and to God we shall return

895
01:33:30,500 --> 01:33:33,083
Hello, 13. This is 19.

896
01:33:33,167 --> 01:33:35,583
<i>Call sign 12 is under attack.</i>

897
01:33:35,667 --> 01:33:38,375
Go forward and help them, over.

898
01:33:38,458 --> 01:33:39,625
13 copy.

899
01:33:40,292 --> 01:33:42,292
We will make a move now, over.

900
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:43,958
<i>19, out.</i>

901
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,958
If it's delayed like this, we're screwed.

902
01:34:04,042 --> 01:34:05,042
Sir.

903
01:34:10,792 --> 01:34:12,667
Sir, are you okay?

904
01:34:15,000 --> 01:34:16,875
Wan, cover at the front.

905
01:34:16,958 --> 01:34:18,792
I want to see in case there's an ambush.

906
01:34:18,875 --> 01:34:19,875
Yes, sir.

907
01:34:38,208 --> 01:34:39,625
Sir, are you okay?

908
01:34:47,083 --> 01:34:48,167
Are you okay, sir?

909
01:34:50,750 --> 01:34:52,833
Sir, are you okay?

910
01:34:55,750 --> 01:34:56,750
Are you okay?

911
01:34:56,833 --> 01:34:58,000
Praise be to God, sir.

912
01:34:58,583 --> 01:35:00,958
It's lucky that you moved, sir, or else…

913
01:35:17,208 --> 01:35:18,208
Understood?

914
01:35:38,167 --> 01:35:40,042
Ali, pull the chopper out now.

915
01:35:40,125 --> 01:35:41,417
Yes, sir.

916
01:35:47,542 --> 01:35:50,292
Put more pressure. A little bit more.

917
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:06,750
Praise be to God.

918
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:25,375
Praise be to God.

919
01:36:25,458 --> 01:36:26,458
29.

920
01:36:28,667 --> 01:36:30,333
Move to the RV now.

921
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:32,500
Move to the RV now, out.

922
01:36:32,583 --> 01:36:35,375
<i>Hello, 29. This is 21.</i>

923
01:36:35,458 --> 01:36:40,583
Call sign 21 Alpha and 54 Alpha
are still lost.

924
01:36:40,667 --> 01:36:43,000
{\an8}<i>What do we do? Over.</i>

925
01:36:43,083 --> 01:36:44,208
{\an8}29.

926
01:36:44,958 --> 01:36:46,375
{\an8}Don't worry.

927
01:36:46,458 --> 01:36:48,375
{\an8}I will contact the Americans.

928
01:36:49,042 --> 01:36:52,833
{\an8}We won't go home
until we find all our men, out.

929
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:19,125
Pok Nik!

930
01:38:19,208 --> 01:38:21,333
Pok Nik, cover me!

931
01:38:45,375 --> 01:38:46,500
Abdalle!

932
01:39:35,917 --> 01:39:37,958
Lee, we have no way out.

933
01:39:38,042 --> 01:39:39,458
We've been surrounded.

934
01:39:49,708 --> 01:39:51,167
Son of a bitch.

935
01:40:38,708 --> 01:40:39,875
Dear, God.

936
01:40:41,417 --> 01:40:44,792
Unite us with our brothers in arms.

937
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:49,792
There is no power and no strength
except with God's permission.

938
01:40:51,000 --> 01:40:52,417
God is the greatest!

939
01:40:54,042 --> 01:40:57,375
Sir, all the Rangers at Objective B
have been rescued,

940
01:40:57,458 --> 01:40:59,750
but Super 64 is a total loss.

941
01:40:59,833 --> 01:41:01,500
Two pilots cannot be detected.

942
01:41:01,583 --> 01:41:03,708
Combat Team Charlie
is given the order to retreat.

943
01:41:03,792 --> 01:41:06,250
<i>Hello, 19. This is 12.</i>

944
01:41:06,333 --> 01:41:08,375
<i>I see a red flare up ahead.</i>

945
01:41:08,458 --> 01:41:09,708
<i>It looks like our signal.</i>

946
01:41:09,792 --> 01:41:12,042
<i>It's 1 km from here, over.</i>

947
01:41:12,792 --> 01:41:13,792
19.

948
01:41:14,542 --> 01:41:17,292
It's call sign 21, right? Over.

949
01:41:17,375 --> 01:41:20,458
<i>12, I'm not sure sir, out.</i>

950
01:41:21,708 --> 01:41:24,333
Sir, we can confirm that it's our condor.

951
01:41:24,417 --> 01:41:25,583
Copy that.

952
01:41:25,667 --> 01:41:28,125
Ask them to accompany our platoon
for a rescue mission.

953
01:41:28,208 --> 01:41:30,875
Sir, they informed us earlier
that they couldn't make it.

954
01:41:48,583 --> 01:41:51,000
<i>Hello, 13. This is 19.</i>

955
01:41:51,083 --> 01:41:55,083
<i>Move forward
to assist the strayed APC, over.</i>

956
01:41:55,167 --> 01:41:59,083
13, I'm in the lead
and I'm not strayed, over.

957
01:41:59,167 --> 01:42:02,167
19, calm down. It's not you.

958
01:42:02,250 --> 01:42:04,583
Two APCs from Combat Team Alpha, over.

959
01:42:04,667 --> 01:42:06,250
13, copy.

960
01:42:06,333 --> 01:42:08,875
I misunderstood, over.

961
01:42:08,958 --> 01:42:12,750
19, the chopper above
will show you the way to our APC.

962
01:42:12,833 --> 01:42:13,708
Go quickly.

963
01:42:13,792 --> 01:42:16,292
Flare reveals their position to the enemy.

964
01:42:16,875 --> 01:42:18,833
They are vulnerable now, out.

965
01:42:19,333 --> 01:42:20,750
You wanted a war so bad, right?

966
01:42:23,125 --> 01:42:24,125
Let's go.

967
01:42:24,208 --> 01:42:25,708
Now let's go to war.

968
01:42:27,208 --> 01:42:29,542
Hello, all call sign 13.

969
01:42:29,625 --> 01:42:32,125
<i>Move forward and follow me.</i>

970
01:42:32,208 --> 01:42:35,417
<i>Move forward and follow me, out.</i>

971
01:43:12,083 --> 01:43:14,958
Come out and shoot there.

972
01:43:57,958 --> 01:43:58,958
Lee.

973
01:43:59,000 --> 01:44:00,000
Lee!

974
01:44:01,542 --> 01:44:02,917
The first light is in an hour.

975
01:44:03,500 --> 01:44:05,500
We won't make it out
during the daytime, Lee.

976
01:45:37,917 --> 01:45:42,000
Hurry, find a spot to engage.
Fire at them.

977
01:46:20,917 --> 01:46:22,917
Get into position, stand by.

978
01:47:06,333 --> 01:47:08,875
They're approaching. Open fire on them.

979
01:47:19,167 --> 01:47:20,792
You think I'm scared?

980
01:47:20,875 --> 01:47:22,500
Faris, hit it.

981
01:47:35,208 --> 01:47:38,125
05:57C

982
01:47:39,542 --> 01:47:40,958
Faris, turn right.

983
01:47:59,708 --> 01:48:03,000
What are you waiting for? Hurry.

984
01:48:37,417 --> 01:48:38,750
Abdalle.

985
01:49:04,125 --> 01:49:06,083
- Get up!
- I can't leave.

986
01:49:12,708 --> 01:49:13,750
Abdalle.

987
01:49:37,083 --> 01:49:39,417
You can still do that, dumbass!

988
01:49:52,750 --> 01:49:55,042
{\an8}Lee, we've got to move.

989
01:49:55,125 --> 01:49:56,167
{\an8}Come.

990
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:21,250
Pok Nik, stop.

991
01:50:22,083 --> 01:50:22,958
Faster.

992
01:50:23,042 --> 01:50:24,583
Ramlee.

993
01:51:58,292 --> 01:51:59,333
Ramlee.

994
01:52:21,000 --> 01:52:22,917
Sir, Combat Team Alpha and Charlie

995
01:52:23,000 --> 01:52:24,625
are on their way back to base, sir.

996
01:52:25,542 --> 01:52:26,782
Our mission is successful, sir.

997
01:52:30,708 --> 01:52:31,917
Operation Officer.

998
01:52:32,000 --> 01:52:33,250
- Well done, sir.
- Good job.

999
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:36,208
Intelligence Officer, any more casualties?

1000
01:52:36,292 --> 01:52:37,708
Praise be to God. None, sir.

1001
01:52:37,792 --> 01:52:39,292
Only a few were injured,

1002
01:52:39,375 --> 01:52:40,792
but are still stable.

1003
01:52:40,875 --> 01:52:43,208
Intelligence Officer, instruct the US

1004
01:52:43,292 --> 01:52:45,417
to destroy two APCs of ours.

1005
01:52:45,500 --> 01:52:47,917
I don't want our assets
to fall into the enemy's hands.

1006
01:52:48,000 --> 01:52:49,000
Yes, sir.

1007
01:53:17,708 --> 01:53:20,125
I can share stories
about wars like this with no shame

1008
01:53:20,208 --> 01:53:21,583
with the people of Alor Gajah.

1009
01:53:22,417 --> 01:53:24,875
I won't be surprised
if they build a mosque in my name.

1010
01:56:06,000 --> 01:56:07,000
How did it hit?

1011
01:56:07,042 --> 01:56:08,458
I have no idea.

1012
01:56:08,542 --> 01:56:09,750
We have to ask the boss.

1013
01:56:10,833 --> 01:56:12,208
Are you harmed? Okay?

1014
01:56:13,000 --> 01:56:15,500
I'm okay. Praise be to God.

1015
01:56:15,583 --> 01:56:19,417
- Johan, Dahari, and Ilyas.
- Hey.

1016
01:56:20,917 --> 01:56:22,000
You're still here.

1017
01:56:23,000 --> 01:56:25,125
Yes, praise be to God.

1018
01:56:25,208 --> 01:56:28,167
We are the 19th Battalion
of the Royal Malay Regiment.

1019
01:56:29,458 --> 01:56:31,417
Whatever the issue is,
we face it together.

1020
01:56:32,875 --> 01:56:33,875
Have you forgotten?

1021
01:56:33,917 --> 01:56:36,583
If you carve this,
orange blood will come out.

1022
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:40,500
This is the face of a war soldier.

1023
01:56:41,167 --> 01:56:43,042
Why are your faces clean?

1024
01:56:44,208 --> 01:56:45,333
Answer it.

1025
01:56:46,708 --> 01:56:47,583
Mus.

1026
01:56:47,667 --> 01:56:49,708
Mus, are you okay?

1027
01:56:53,250 --> 01:56:54,458
It all happened too fast.

1028
01:56:55,458 --> 01:56:56,708
I couldn't do anything.

1029
01:56:58,250 --> 01:56:59,250
What happened?

1030
01:57:17,583 --> 01:57:18,583
- Sir.
- Sir.

1031
01:57:51,667 --> 01:57:53,792
I will make sure
his wife and children know

1032
01:57:54,583 --> 01:57:56,667
that he died a hero.

1033
01:59:37,458 --> 01:59:38,667
Lee.

1034
01:59:58,250 --> 02:00:01,667
He can still flirt in this condition?

1035
02:00:01,750 --> 02:00:04,167
If he can breathe, he can flirt.

1036
02:00:05,167 --> 02:00:06,750
Did I succeed

1037
02:00:07,417 --> 02:00:08,792
in making the country proud?

1038
02:00:10,042 --> 02:00:13,292
Make the country proud? I'm not sure.

1039
02:00:14,625 --> 02:00:17,750
But you made me proud.

1040
02:00:30,708 --> 02:00:31,708
Zul.

1041
02:00:34,083 --> 02:00:35,792
Take care of yourself.

1042
02:00:37,917 --> 02:00:40,875
Eat your meds. Make sure you eat right.

1043
02:00:40,958 --> 02:00:42,167
You need to...

1044
02:00:55,292 --> 02:00:56,875
Speaking the white man's language.

1045
02:01:44,375 --> 02:01:45,375
So…

1046
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:48,292
What now?

1047
02:01:48,375 --> 02:01:50,000
The world knows us now.

1048
02:01:51,000 --> 02:01:52,000
What else?

1049
02:03:38,917 --> 02:03:41,167
THAT IS WHY WE ORDAINED
FOR THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL

1050
02:03:41,250 --> 02:03:42,542
THAT WHOEVER TAKES A LIFE

1051
02:03:42,625 --> 02:03:45,250
UNLESS AS A PUNISHMENT FOR MURDER
OR MISCHIEF IN THE LAND,

1052
02:03:45,333 --> 02:03:47,417
IT WILL BE AS IF
THEY KILLED ALL OF HUMANITY.

1053
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:50,792
WHOEVER SAVES A LIFE, IT WILL BE
AS IF THEY SAVED ALL OF HUMANITY.

1054
02:03:50,875 --> 02:03:53,792
ALTHOUGH OUR MESSENGERS ALREADY
CAME TO THEM WITH CLEAR PROOF,

1055
02:03:53,875 --> 02:03:56,667
MANY OF THEM STILL TRANSGRESSED
AFTERWARD THROUGH THE LAND.
