WEBVTT

00:00:51.208 --> 00:00:52.958
Monkey King, you bastard

00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:54.417
You've promised Buddha

00:00:54.625 --> 00:00:56.750
To help the Longevity Monk
to get scriptures in the west

00:00:57.042 --> 00:00:59.375
But the King Bull and you decided to
eat your master

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.500
Do you know you've made a real big
mistake?

00:01:02.708 --> 00:01:03.708
Shut up!

00:01:05.125 --> 00:01:06.917
You've followed me for 3 days

00:01:07.292 --> 00:01:09.250
I didn't beat you up because you're
a woman

00:01:09.583 --> 00:01:11.083
Don't think that I'm afraid of you

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:12.792
Monkey King

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.792
be polite to Goddess!

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:18.125
Shut up

00:01:19.125 --> 00:01:20.917
You scare me again

00:01:22.917 --> 00:01:24.208
If you're not scared of me

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.750
you needn't hurt Purple Fairy

00:01:25.792 --> 00:01:27.875
and stole her Pandora's Box

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:30.083
You just wanna escape

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:31.833
Now, I can't escape

00:01:32.042 --> 00:01:33.583
I will fight with you

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.167
What's up?

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:40.167
Don't be angry

00:01:40.375 --> 00:01:42.375
You may violate the rule

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:44.417
Monkey King, you're so naughty!

00:01:44.625 --> 00:01:45.583
I've told you

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:48.208
not to throw things!

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.958
Look!

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.333
You've thrown away the stick

00:01:51.583 --> 00:01:52.792
Pandora's Box is the treasure

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.958
You'll pollute the environment

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:56.917
You'll hurt kids

00:01:57.125 --> 00:01:58.125
If there are no kids

00:01:58.333 --> 00:02:01.417
it is bad to hurt plants

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:04.208
What's up?

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.625
Let go!

00:02:05.833 --> 00:02:06.958
You want?

00:02:07.167 --> 00:02:09.292
Speak up if you want!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.375
Why do you keep silent?

00:02:11.625 --> 00:02:13.125
Although your eyes are full of sincerity

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:16.292
I'm very glad, you still have to speak up

00:02:16.542 --> 00:02:17.375
Do you really like?

00:02:17.625 --> 00:02:19.000
Take it

00:02:19.208 --> 00:02:20.542
Do you really like?

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:21.792
You

00:02:21.833 --> 00:02:23.125
Damn!

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.958
Monkey King...

00:02:27.792 --> 00:02:29.208
See

00:02:29.417 --> 00:02:30.917
this guy keeps talking all the time

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:32.458
we don't know what he's talking about

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:35.250
He's just like a fly hanging around

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:38.458
Sorry, not a fly

00:02:38.708 --> 00:02:40.958
It's a swarm of flies flying near your ears

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:47.833
Flying into your brain

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.542
Help!

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:57.542
Help!

00:02:59.625 --> 00:03:02.375
So I catch that fly. Open its belly

00:03:02.417 --> 00:03:03.333
Take out its intestine

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:05.042
Put its intestine around its own neck

00:03:05.083 --> 00:03:07.125
Then I pull the intestine tightly

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.458
The tongue comes out

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:11.708
I use a blade and cut!

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.333
Wow!

00:03:15.708 --> 00:03:18.958
All the people keep silent

00:03:21.625 --> 00:03:28.500
Now you know why I need to kill

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:31.500
Monkey King, you have so many excuses

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.833
You don't want to get scriptures
in the west

00:03:34.958 --> 00:03:37.125
Shut up please! Beat!

00:03:51.833 --> 00:03:53.083
I've got a super body. You can't hurt me

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.083
I don't scare of any god

00:04:08.458 --> 00:04:10.833
I'm detroy all devils

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:13.500
Being master
I should take the responsibility

00:04:13.667 --> 00:04:15.542
Please let him go!

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.750
I have to do so
I need to report to Heaven Emperor

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:20.625
Goddess, please tell Heaven Emperor

00:04:20.875 --> 00:04:23.042
I can sacrifice my life for him

00:04:33.958 --> 00:04:38.583
Namonitabhaya...

00:06:48.542 --> 00:06:50.083
What did he said?

00:06:52.042 --> 00:06:53.042
Give him the pork

00:06:54.958 --> 00:06:55.792
Stand by!

00:06:56.042 --> 00:06:57.125
A woman is coming in!

00:06:57.375 --> 00:06:59.667
Asst. Master
do you think soldiers are coming?

00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:01.708
This is why you're called Blind Bing

00:07:02.208 --> 00:07:04.583
Didn't you see Dumby shaking his ass?

00:07:04.958 --> 00:07:07.333
Do you think he has hemorrhoids?

00:07:07.708 --> 00:07:09.042
OK, even if he has hemorrhoids

00:07:09.208 --> 00:07:11.333
he is a soldier with hemorrhoids

00:07:11.542 --> 00:07:12.542
So what to be feared about him?

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:40.792
Who the hell you are?

00:07:41.542 --> 00:07:44.917
Don't you reckon I'm a woman?

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.667
What do you come here for?

00:07:50.583 --> 00:07:52.708
The world's gone mad

00:07:52.917 --> 00:07:53.708
A weary lady

00:07:53.917 --> 00:07:56.083
Iooking for a shelter

00:07:56.375 --> 00:07:58.250
I wanna brush off the dust of my past

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:01.833
Do you know what place it is?

00:08:02.458 --> 00:08:05.583
This is not a nice place
You all look gruesome

00:08:06.958 --> 00:08:09.125
I don't think it is a decent tavern

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:11.458
Is this a slaughter-house?

00:08:12.042 --> 00:08:14.958
Yes, we are. How dare you come in

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.125
You're in danger already

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.250
I'm not sure who's in danger

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.333
I think you're in danger

00:08:23.625 --> 00:08:25.917
You can be robbers

00:08:26.083 --> 00:08:29.042
So can I

00:08:30.792 --> 00:08:32.958
Who the hell you are?

00:08:43.458 --> 00:08:44.750
Blossom

00:08:45.042 --> 00:08:48.000
Nothing get into my way and survive

00:08:48.208 --> 00:08:50.458
Money or your heads

00:08:59.167 --> 00:09:02.667
Why does Ma'am 30th come to
Mt Wuyue?

00:09:03.167 --> 00:09:06.833
This devil is a fierce robber

00:09:07.542 --> 00:09:11.458
Is here having big business?

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:16.292
Why do you still

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:17.792
put the money on your head?

00:09:18.083 --> 00:09:19.125
Put it back!

00:09:19.292 --> 00:09:21.542
She said it is our head or the money
Master

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:22.667
What are you talking about?

00:09:23.125 --> 00:09:25.917
Asst. Master!

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.583
You coward!
How can you be my assistant?

00:09:28.792 --> 00:09:31.250
Master, I'm not Asst. Master!
I'm Blind Bing!

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:32.083
He is Asst. Master

00:09:32.292 --> 00:09:33.417
I will make you regret!

00:09:34.167 --> 00:09:35.500
I will make you regret!

00:09:36.292 --> 00:09:38.042
Go away!

00:09:38.417 --> 00:09:40.750
Look at yourself
Mousing around, so shameful

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.083
How can you follow me around
with their hair?

00:09:42.333 --> 00:09:44.500
How can you follow me around
with their hair?

00:09:44.708 --> 00:09:46.875
Master, I'm here!

00:09:47.292 --> 00:09:48.250
Come out!

00:09:48.458 --> 00:09:49.667
Coming

00:09:50.125 --> 00:09:51.833
Master, you're hit by Kunlun Sage's
7 Ultimate Fists

00:09:52.042 --> 00:09:53.500
Your wounds are spreading

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:54.792
Shut up

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.208
you knelt down that time

00:09:56.417 --> 00:09:57.875
and I got hit in the nose

00:09:58.083 --> 00:09:59.333
Master, here!

00:09:59.708 --> 00:10:01.958
The 7 Ultimate Fists really hurt Master

00:10:02.208 --> 00:10:04.583
Master, I was scared, so I knelt down

00:10:04.833 --> 00:10:05.958
It is heard that people who got hit by the
7 Ultimate Fists

00:10:06.208 --> 00:10:07.250
will have disease in his eyes

00:10:07.458 --> 00:10:09.167
Then he'll become dumb

00:10:09.417 --> 00:10:11.583
After that he can't speak properly

00:10:11.792 --> 00:10:14.333
At last, his body explodes and he's dead

00:10:14.542 --> 00:10:15.667
Master, there's something wrong with
your eyes!

00:10:15.958 --> 00:10:16.750
I am OK!

00:10:16.958 --> 00:10:18.208
I only concentrate my eyesight on a
single point

00:10:18.458 --> 00:10:20.417
I only change my usual way of vision

00:10:20.667 --> 00:10:22.250
Do you want to take my position?

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:23.792
No, Master, I don't dare

00:10:24.167 --> 00:10:25.542
You don't dare? I am gonna kill you!

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:27.167
Kill you!

00:10:27.417 --> 00:10:29.625
Can you cry out for me?

00:10:30.708 --> 00:10:31.875
Ah...

00:10:32.375 --> 00:10:35.125
Ok, let's get our weapons and search

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:36.625
Ma'am 30th

00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:39.542
No need to scare! I'm here!

00:10:44.583 --> 00:10:46.250
I'm the leader of the Axe Gang

00:10:46.458 --> 00:10:49.208
My nickname is Joker

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:51.958
It is nice to meet famous Ma'am 30th

00:10:52.167 --> 00:10:53.750
What are you gonna

00:10:53.802 --> 00:10:55.417
do here?

00:10:56.792 --> 00:10:58.583
I just wanna stay here for a while

00:10:59.208 --> 00:11:01.417
A while? How long is it?

00:11:01.625 --> 00:11:03.125
3 full days

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.958
Maybe 30 or 50 years

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.208
I'll leave when I meet the person

00:11:09.458 --> 00:11:10.458
who I want to see

00:11:12.042 --> 00:11:13.708
I don't think you can wait so long

00:11:17.875 --> 00:11:18.875
What are you doing?

00:11:19.083 --> 00:11:20.375
I've just had a piss!

00:11:21.292 --> 00:11:22.375
You had a piss here?

00:11:22.625 --> 00:11:24.333
This is why you have so much water
to bath

00:11:24.542 --> 00:11:25.542
What are you talking about?

00:11:25.792 --> 00:11:28.167
I said live to see that person

00:11:35.875 --> 00:11:39.958
Master...

00:12:05.917 --> 00:12:07.542
I'm not that easy to kill

00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:09.625
Ask my brothers first

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.583
You have no guts...

00:12:15.958 --> 00:12:19.208
You betray me!

00:12:19.458 --> 00:12:21.500
God!

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:24.542
Kill us all if you can!

00:12:27.167 --> 00:12:28.583
Forgive me...

00:12:28.875 --> 00:12:29.667
Forgive me, heroine...

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:31.667
Stupid! Do you think she will let you go?

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:33.833
I'm gonna fight

00:12:34.083 --> 00:12:35.208
even if I lost my life!

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:38.875
That's fine. Since you're willing to beg me

00:12:39.125 --> 00:12:41.417
I won't kill you now

00:12:41.708 --> 00:12:43.542
Thanks a lot!...

00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.208
You...you're so righteous!

00:12:56.583 --> 00:12:58.250
You're so good!

00:13:00.250 --> 00:13:02.667
You all clean your sole and wait for me
outside

00:13:09.750 --> 00:13:10.708
Why is there a scar?

00:13:11.042 --> 00:13:12.583
This is not a scar, it is only dirt

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:13.458
Go clean it

00:13:13.708 --> 00:13:14.792
or I'll cut the whole leg off

00:13:15.083 --> 00:13:16.042
Master

00:13:16.333 --> 00:13:17.625
why she wanna see our sole?

00:13:17.875 --> 00:13:19.875
It is lucky that you don't wanna see
our ass

00:13:20.375 --> 00:13:21.083
Are you scared?

00:13:21.292 --> 00:13:22.583
I'm not! You are scared!

00:13:22.875 --> 00:13:23.542
Why?

00:13:23.750 --> 00:13:24.792
You have hemorrhoids

00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:25.667
She'll say they are not clean enough

00:13:25.958 --> 00:13:26.708
and cut them off

00:13:26.958 --> 00:13:27.875
Why do you know I have hemorrhoids?

00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:29.875
Blind Bing peeped on your shower

00:13:30.375 --> 00:13:31.750
Why did you peep on me?

00:13:32.125 --> 00:13:33.083
I not only peeped on you

00:13:33.333 --> 00:13:34.875
I've peeped on you all

00:13:38.292 --> 00:13:39.833
Why is there so much hair?

00:13:40.042 --> 00:13:40.750
Sure

00:13:40.958 --> 00:13:42.708
I've got more in other parts

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:43.417
What?

00:13:43.667 --> 00:13:44.667
Are you excited now?

00:13:44.917 --> 00:13:49.042
Where did you say has more hair?

00:13:49.333 --> 00:13:50.250
No

00:13:50.458 --> 00:13:52.125
in fact I only have hair on my head and
sole

00:13:52.333 --> 00:13:53.958
Do you think
they grow on the wrong places?

00:13:55.375 --> 00:13:57.625
From now on, I'll check all the people

00:13:57.917 --> 00:13:59.125
passing here!

00:13:59.958 --> 00:14:01.292
Check what?

00:14:01.833 --> 00:14:03.167
Check their sole

00:14:03.333 --> 00:14:05.333
If you discover a guy having
three birthmarks, tell me

00:14:13.167 --> 00:14:14.958
Master! We don't go to rob

00:14:15.208 --> 00:14:16.167
but check people's sole

00:14:16.458 --> 00:14:19.458
If the others know that
they'll say we're perverts

00:14:19.708 --> 00:14:21.875
We can plot against her

00:14:22.083 --> 00:14:23.833
Poison her, make her faint

00:14:23.875 --> 00:14:24.833
then rape and kill her!

00:14:25.125 --> 00:14:26.083
A good plot!

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:27.500
You think so

00:14:27.708 --> 00:14:29.250
You shall administer the plan

00:14:29.625 --> 00:14:31.250
I don't think I can do this

00:14:31.708 --> 00:14:33.958
I go, no need to kneel down

00:14:34.208 --> 00:14:37.042
I don't want to! I can't control my legs

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.958
Master, your wound is expanding

00:14:39.208 --> 00:14:40.917
I still have both hands

00:14:41.417 --> 00:14:43.750
I won't give up!

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:49.875
Master has fallen into a shit pit!

00:14:50.083 --> 00:14:51.208
Master!

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:35.750
Have you found the three birthmarks?

00:15:36.417 --> 00:15:38.583
Why does everyone tell me to find
the three birthmarks?

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.333
You can save him when you find them

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:42.292
What are you talking about?

00:15:42.583 --> 00:15:43.792
Where are we?

00:15:43.958 --> 00:15:44.750
Who?

00:15:48.083 --> 00:15:49.125
Dreaming

00:15:51.292 --> 00:15:53.083
Did you kill that bitch?

00:15:59.083 --> 00:16:03.042
Spider! Spider...

00:16:03.292 --> 00:16:04.375
It's only a spider

00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:05.208
It's big

00:16:05.458 --> 00:16:06.333
How big is it?

00:16:09.917 --> 00:16:11.542
I've told you to tidy up the place

00:16:11.583 --> 00:16:13.792
The spiders are bigger than me

00:16:13.958 --> 00:16:15.042
What should I do?

00:16:17.792 --> 00:16:19.792
It keeps running after me

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.833
Maybe I'm handsome

00:16:29.417 --> 00:16:30.667
What?

00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:19.792
What's up?

00:17:20.042 --> 00:17:21.167
A spider is running after Master?

00:17:21.417 --> 00:17:22.333
This way? No...

00:17:22.542 --> 00:17:23.875
This way!

00:17:24.083 --> 00:17:25.375
Fine, be quick!

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:29.333
How come?

00:17:37.083 --> 00:17:38.333
Help!

00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:42.583
Come here! I'm here!

00:17:43.167 --> 00:17:44.458
Be quick!

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:46.375
I'm here!

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.417
Help me!

00:17:50.292 --> 00:17:51.875
Blind Bing!

00:17:52.083 --> 00:17:53.750
Nothing in the front!
Turn back, turn back!

00:17:53.958 --> 00:17:55.458
No! it's Master! Master...

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.625
Isn't it a cockroach?

00:17:56.875 --> 00:17:57.833
It's Master

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.042
Great! Go!

00:18:00.583 --> 00:18:02.042
You sons of bitches, deceive me

00:18:03.042 --> 00:18:04.750
Master, I'm coming

00:18:11.917 --> 00:18:13.167
What am I touching?

00:18:13.625 --> 00:18:16.917
Master is saved...

00:18:17.542 --> 00:18:19.875
Asst. Master is so happy
What is he holding?

00:18:20.917 --> 00:18:22.625
Master, didn't he carry you out?

00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.708
I'm fine, let's go home...

00:18:28.750 --> 00:18:29.750
Take a bath, go to bed sooner

00:18:29.958 --> 00:18:31.500
Don't hang around tonight

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:33.958
Let go!

00:18:34.208 --> 00:18:35.958
Spider!

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:38.125
Blindy

00:18:38.333 --> 00:18:39.667
Help

00:18:40.500 --> 00:18:41.833
Who?

00:18:42.417 --> 00:18:46.208
Burn it!

00:18:48.042 --> 00:18:50.292
Have a rest first

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:52.500
Burn it!

00:18:53.750 --> 00:18:55.042
Don't let him go...burn it

00:18:55.083 --> 00:18:56.208
Burn it!

00:18:56.458 --> 00:18:57.750
No need to be frightened

00:18:57.792 --> 00:18:59.375
Burn him...

00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:01.417
He's there...

00:19:01.667 --> 00:19:03.417
It's over there, go there...

00:19:12.167 --> 00:19:13.458
Here is another

00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:14.750
This one is smaller

00:19:25.750 --> 00:19:26.750
Freeze!

00:19:40.625 --> 00:19:42.417
Where?

00:19:42.750 --> 00:19:43.792
It's there!

00:19:43.958 --> 00:19:45.292
There!

00:20:03.875 --> 00:20:06.667
Only two claws are left
Let me break you in half

00:20:11.542 --> 00:20:13.042
Go to hell

00:20:20.792 --> 00:20:21.833
Don't go!

00:20:23.125 --> 00:20:25.250
It's here

00:20:26.625 --> 00:20:33.208
Beat it!

00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:37.750
Give it to me

00:20:42.375 --> 00:20:45.375
All spread out! Let me burn it!

00:20:45.583 --> 00:20:47.542
Go to hell!

00:20:49.458 --> 00:20:50.625
Burning!

00:20:51.542 --> 00:20:52.958
Very hot!

00:20:54.625 --> 00:20:56.042
It's Master's voice

00:20:56.250 --> 00:20:57.458
Help!

00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.375
It's Master. Help him!

00:20:59.583 --> 00:21:00.375
It's Master

00:21:00.625 --> 00:21:01.875
Help!

00:21:03.208 --> 00:21:05.333
Master, your cock is burning

00:21:05.542 --> 00:21:06.958
Be quick

00:21:07.167 --> 00:21:08.125
Get the water...

00:21:08.333 --> 00:21:09.042
Put out the fire

00:21:09.292 --> 00:21:10.125
Put out the fire

00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:11.167
Dying!

00:21:11.458 --> 00:21:12.292
Be quick

00:21:12.875 --> 00:21:14.917
I'm going to out the fire, too

00:21:15.250 --> 00:21:17.750
You can't put out the fire with straw
Stay away!

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:18.792
Master, it's OK!

00:21:21.042 --> 00:21:22.625
I'll put it out!

00:21:22.875 --> 00:21:24.708
Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop burning...

00:21:25.167 --> 00:21:27.042
Out you go...!

00:21:27.375 --> 00:21:29.792
Stop burning!

00:21:30.458 --> 00:21:32.875
I can't take this...

00:21:48.583 --> 00:21:50.167
The fire is out! Are you OK?

00:21:51.625 --> 00:21:54.667
You have to step on him and
put the fire out

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:56.250
Moron!

00:21:58.958 --> 00:21:59.958
Who burned me?

00:22:00.250 --> 00:22:01.208
Not me!

00:22:01.417 --> 00:22:02.042
I have no idea

00:22:03.417 --> 00:22:05.208
I know it's you!

00:22:05.708 --> 00:22:07.875
I know what you're thinking!

00:22:08.083 --> 00:22:09.042
You wanna take my place!

00:22:09.208 --> 00:22:10.042
No...Master...

00:22:10.292 --> 00:22:11.292
Master's eyes are Ok

00:22:11.625 --> 00:22:12.708
No, I didn't do that

00:22:12.917 --> 00:22:15.250
Master, you've recovered

00:22:15.917 --> 00:22:17.042
I'm cured! Why?

00:22:18.125 --> 00:22:19.000
I know!

00:22:19.208 --> 00:22:20.792
You must hurt yourself in order to

00:22:21.083 --> 00:22:21.625
cure the wounds

00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:23.792
It's reasonable!

00:22:24.083 --> 00:22:25.958
You have to thank Asst. Master

00:22:26.167 --> 00:22:27.583
If he didn't hit you at the crotch

00:22:27.833 --> 00:22:29.167
you won't be healed so fast

00:22:29.375 --> 00:22:31.333
Do you have an affair with him?

00:22:31.542 --> 00:22:32.917
I love you so much

00:22:33.208 --> 00:22:34.958
Go to hell! Stop it!

00:22:36.833 --> 00:22:38.542
I've told you to kill Ma'am 30th

00:22:38.833 --> 00:22:39.625
Have you done that?

00:22:39.833 --> 00:22:40.750
Ma'am 30th is a devil!

00:22:41.208 --> 00:22:42.708
Spider Woman!

00:22:43.042 --> 00:22:44.875
I'm a rational man

00:22:45.083 --> 00:22:47.333
I can't accept such ridiculous thing!

00:22:47.583 --> 00:22:48.375
Kill her!

00:22:48.542 --> 00:22:50.083
Master, aren't you scared?

00:22:50.292 --> 00:22:51.833
Of course not! I'm healed

00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:52.750
I will defeat her!

00:22:52.917 --> 00:22:54.375
Great! You have guts!

00:22:54.583 --> 00:22:56.167
You said I had guts?

00:22:56.375 --> 00:22:57.750
Yes, but forget I'd say that

00:22:57.792 --> 00:22:58.708
Master

00:22:58.958 --> 00:23:01.125
You just get into her room and
finish her off

00:23:01.417 --> 00:23:02.583
We'll cover you up!

00:23:02.875 --> 00:23:03.958
Why I go first everytime...

00:23:16.208 --> 00:23:18.167
You said you would cover me up
so stay closer

00:23:18.375 --> 00:23:19.292
Steady

00:23:19.458 --> 00:23:21.208
we've got weapons

00:23:21.417 --> 00:23:23.083
We'll throw them at her

00:23:24.167 --> 00:23:25.875
You'll kill me, too

00:23:26.125 --> 00:23:27.083
Don't be silly!

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:29.042
You won't die, you'll only get hurt!

00:23:33.417 --> 00:23:34.542
Sons of bitches!

00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:39.667
Get! You are not fooling me

00:23:39.917 --> 00:23:40.750
Listen to me

00:23:41.542 --> 00:23:43.000
Stop that

00:23:44.500 --> 00:23:45.458
Fainted?

00:23:45.625 --> 00:23:46.458
Big Cow, Younger Tiger

00:23:48.583 --> 00:23:51.792
You're all useless. Let me do this

00:24:01.208 --> 00:24:02.417
What?

00:24:03.375 --> 00:24:04.917
You faked the fainted?

00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:08.042
This is a tactic

00:24:08.333 --> 00:24:10.000
It is very useful

00:24:14.708 --> 00:24:16.042
Where is the leak?

00:24:17.583 --> 00:24:19.750
Asst. Master, you're bleeding

00:24:20.167 --> 00:24:22.458
Don't scare!

00:24:22.708 --> 00:24:24.667
I can stop the bleeding

00:24:24.917 --> 00:24:26.042
by myself

00:24:43.625 --> 00:24:45.125
it's not picturesque

00:24:45.333 --> 00:24:46.708
but it is unique

00:24:46.917 --> 00:24:49.042
You may love this place, eventually

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:50.250
Good night!

00:24:54.667 --> 00:24:56.750
Master...

00:24:56.958 --> 00:24:57.917
She is a devil!

00:24:57.958 --> 00:24:59.042
Yes!

00:24:59.375 --> 00:25:00.833
She is a real devil!

00:25:01.083 --> 00:25:03.917
My heart is pounding!

00:25:05.083 --> 00:25:06.500
Master, stop it!

00:25:10.500 --> 00:25:14.292
You're a righteous man, a hero

00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:15.917
It is my pleasure

00:25:16.167 --> 00:25:17.500
to be your friend

00:25:17.708 --> 00:25:19.333
The money put on your bros' heads

00:25:19.542 --> 00:25:21.125
is all given to you to buy drinks

00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:24.708
Thank you very much, Ma'am 30th

00:25:26.083 --> 00:25:27.958
Master, she's not really good-looking

00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:29.833
But I like her!

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.833
Only thrust the thigh once
but there're so many holes

00:25:38.125 --> 00:25:39.208
What do you mean?

00:25:49.917 --> 00:25:52.375
Sister, why did you leave?

00:25:52.625 --> 00:25:54.000
You ran to this poor village

00:25:54.250 --> 00:25:54.958
and you're forced to reveal

00:25:55.250 --> 00:25:57.458
your real image

00:25:57.708 --> 00:25:58.583
What are you doing here?

00:25:58.750 --> 00:25:59.750
How about you?

00:26:00.292 --> 00:26:01.625
I just want to have a walk

00:26:03.125 --> 00:26:04.875
You're waiting for the Longevity Monk

00:26:05.167 --> 00:26:07.042
you wanna eat his flesh

00:26:07.333 --> 00:26:08.167
You can make Granpa Buddha

00:26:08.208 --> 00:26:09.792
speak out this top secret

00:26:10.083 --> 00:26:11.167
So do I

00:26:11.458 --> 00:26:12.417
Nonsense!

00:26:12.625 --> 00:26:15.417
Nonsense?
Why did you come to Mt Wuyue?

00:26:15.625 --> 00:26:17.000
This was called Fingers Mountain
in the past

00:26:17.208 --> 00:26:19.417
It's the prison for this monkey

00:26:19.625 --> 00:26:21.250
The top secret says that
he'll become human

00:26:21.458 --> 00:26:23.917
and he has three birthmarks on his sole

00:26:24.458 --> 00:26:26.750
you can find the Monk
if you know where Monkey King is

00:26:26.917 --> 00:26:29.875
Sister, do you still think I'm speaking nonsense?

00:26:30.125 --> 00:26:32.458
You just want to see that monkey

00:26:33.042 --> 00:26:35.792
You can do nothing even if you see him

00:26:35.958 --> 00:26:38.625
The difference is that
he died in Goddess's hands last time

00:26:39.125 --> 00:26:41.542
but he died in my hands this time

00:26:42.042 --> 00:26:43.375
It will benefit

00:26:43.625 --> 00:26:44.875
only one person

00:26:45.292 --> 00:26:46.750
You know the reason!

00:26:48.042 --> 00:26:49.167
Do you wanna fight over him with me?

00:26:52.708 --> 00:26:53.917
Do you think only you can fake face?

00:26:57.583 --> 00:26:58.792
Who?

00:27:08.292 --> 00:27:10.583
Devil...!

00:27:20.958 --> 00:27:21.667
What did you see?

00:27:21.917 --> 00:27:22.542
Nothing

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.458
No!

00:27:23.708 --> 00:27:24.750
What are you doing down there?

00:27:25.125 --> 00:27:26.125
I wanna tie the lace

00:27:35.917 --> 00:27:37.792
If the secret of the monk leaked

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.167
I'll kill you

00:27:41.292 --> 00:27:42.542
Then, all devils gather at Fingers Mountain

00:27:42.750 --> 00:27:44.667
beg for the flesh of the Longevity Monk

00:27:45.125 --> 00:27:47.667
Tell the King about this

00:27:47.958 --> 00:27:49.583
he will bestow on us

00:27:54.125 --> 00:27:57.583
Even a bull is talking
So many devils here this time

00:27:57.833 --> 00:27:59.250
Go...go away

00:28:00.333 --> 00:28:01.833
If I go now, I'm a coward!

00:28:02.375 --> 00:28:03.958
No, report to Master

00:28:05.167 --> 00:28:06.500
Master

00:28:06.792 --> 00:28:08.250
This mountain was called

00:28:08.542 --> 00:28:09.458
Fingers Mountain in the past

00:28:09.708 --> 00:28:11.667
The Longevity Monk and the
Monkey King will meet here

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.167
My bull is talking

00:28:14.417 --> 00:28:15.083
Those two things

00:28:15.292 --> 00:28:18.042
one has 8 legs, one's head...

00:28:19.917 --> 00:28:21.042
You two haven't slept?

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:22.083
What are you talking about?

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:26.958
ah...

00:28:27.167 --> 00:28:29.250
Two baby pigs are born

00:28:29.417 --> 00:28:32.250
One has 8 legs

00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:34.458
One has a very heavy head

00:28:34.667 --> 00:28:36.083
Master, we're rich now

00:28:36.375 --> 00:28:37.792
We needn't to be robbers anymore...

00:28:38.083 --> 00:28:38.875
We didn't rear any pigs

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:40.208
We didn't rear any pigs?

00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:42.625
Or I'm speaking in my dream!

00:28:42.833 --> 00:28:45.000
Ok, I'm leaving, please take a rest

00:28:45.458 --> 00:28:46.125
We're leaving

00:28:46.375 --> 00:28:47.500
Walk both girls away

00:28:47.708 --> 00:28:48.625
No!

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.167
I will order someone to search for

00:28:51.417 --> 00:28:53.375
the guy you wanna see

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:54.917
Thank you master

00:28:56.208 --> 00:28:58.083
Good night! Go!

00:28:59.292 --> 00:29:00.875
Go! Go!

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:05.708
Nothing can be done this time

00:29:05.917 --> 00:29:07.667
Why does Jing Jing have no reaction

00:29:07.958 --> 00:29:09.417
to this image?

00:29:10.458 --> 00:29:11.375
Nothing I can do

00:29:16.167 --> 00:29:17.333
Go!

00:29:24.417 --> 00:29:29.000
Don't kill me!...Don't kill me!

00:29:31.292 --> 00:29:32.708
I just wanna have fun with you

00:29:33.167 --> 00:29:34.375
Do you like playing?

00:29:34.875 --> 00:29:35.542
Come and have fun

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:40.708
Is it funny?

00:29:40.917 --> 00:29:41.625
Yes!

00:29:41.917 --> 00:29:42.875
Ok, let's play again

00:29:51.375 --> 00:29:52.417
Play again?

00:29:52.708 --> 00:29:54.625
I don't wanna play...

00:29:54.917 --> 00:29:56.333
You said who's got eight claws?

00:29:56.375 --> 00:29:57.833
I can't remember it...

00:29:58.375 --> 00:29:59.375
What?

00:30:01.500 --> 00:30:02.958
No!

00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.667
My head looks like this?

00:30:06.167 --> 00:30:07.708
Yes...! Oh no!

00:30:08.208 --> 00:30:10.750
She's not changed yet

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:15.917
Not yet?

00:30:18.875 --> 00:30:19.750
I'll kill him

00:30:19.917 --> 00:30:20.583
No

00:30:21.750 --> 00:30:22.833
Why?

00:30:23.875 --> 00:30:26.250
I'm gonna mesmerize him

00:30:26.458 --> 00:30:27.917
he'll be my undercover agent

00:30:32.375 --> 00:30:32.875
Hi!

00:30:32.917 --> 00:30:34.500
Ghost!

00:30:35.417 --> 00:30:36.458
Go to have a look

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:39.500
You said a ghost!

00:30:39.708 --> 00:30:41.125
Oh dear!

00:30:42.750 --> 00:30:45.500
Don't be pretentious around here

00:30:45.667 --> 00:30:47.750
Or I will cut you into pieces

00:30:48.417 --> 00:30:49.542
You're so brutal!

00:30:49.708 --> 00:30:50.750
Look at me!

00:30:51.417 --> 00:30:52.875
Mesmerizing!

00:31:01.250 --> 00:31:02.250
Who?

00:31:03.125 --> 00:31:05.250
It's a long night, no mood to sleep

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.542
I thought I am the only one

00:31:07.750 --> 00:31:10.750
But Jing Jing, you're sleepless, too?

00:31:13.917 --> 00:31:17.292
Yes, why can't you sleep?

00:31:17.792 --> 00:31:20.250
Just because of Jing Jing!

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:21.708
Me?

00:31:22.250 --> 00:31:24.667
yes, when I saw you

00:31:24.875 --> 00:31:27.500
I made up my mind that
I wouldn't be a robber

00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:30.333
I just wanna show my sincerity

00:31:30.542 --> 00:31:32.875
I can't face my past

00:31:33.208 --> 00:31:34.292
Like what you see?

00:31:35.833 --> 00:31:37.125
You're monkey?

00:31:37.708 --> 00:31:38.667
Monkey?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:39.750
Monkey King

00:31:40.083 --> 00:31:41.042
Monkey King?

00:31:41.208 --> 00:31:42.083
You think you're alright with a
human face?

00:31:42.250 --> 00:31:43.250
Human Face?

00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:45.667
I have to use Skeleton Fire on you

00:31:46.583 --> 00:31:49.333
You gonna burn me again!

00:31:49.583 --> 00:31:51.083
Why?

00:31:51.625 --> 00:31:52.708
Did I make a mistake?

00:31:53.042 --> 00:31:55.083
Why?

00:31:57.750 --> 00:31:59.333
Why did you use flame bomb to burn me?

00:31:59.542 --> 00:32:00.833
Why did you shave off your beard?

00:32:00.875 --> 00:32:02.250
You're just another guy

00:32:02.500 --> 00:32:03.125
without the beard

00:32:03.292 --> 00:32:04.208
Really?

00:32:04.667 --> 00:32:05.958
You can't do anything

00:32:06.292 --> 00:32:08.375
Do you want to be a scholar instead of
a robber?

00:32:08.792 --> 00:32:09.958
I've thought about this

00:32:10.167 --> 00:32:11.750
Please stop changing image

00:32:11.958 --> 00:32:13.917
being a robber is

00:32:14.167 --> 00:32:15.000
a good job

00:32:15.667 --> 00:32:16.500
I know

00:32:16.750 --> 00:32:18.667
I'll try my best!

00:32:18.875 --> 00:32:20.500
You look like that thing!

00:32:22.208 --> 00:32:23.208
So pathetic

00:32:24.375 --> 00:32:26.917
Jing Jing loves my violent side

00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:35.917
Having the personality again

00:32:53.042 --> 00:32:54.667
Monkey King, come out!

00:32:55.708 --> 00:32:56.875
Damn monkey

00:32:57.125 --> 00:32:59.167
You said you would marry me
when I was 18

00:32:59.375 --> 00:33:00.417
I have waited for you 3 years

00:33:00.625 --> 00:33:01.708
You come out!

00:33:02.250 --> 00:33:04.083
Our King is not here

00:33:04.292 --> 00:33:07.083
He said give it Miss Pak
when you come here

00:33:07.250 --> 00:33:09.083
and thanked Miss Pak very much

00:33:09.333 --> 00:33:11.167
He can't enjoy it

00:33:20.708 --> 00:33:22.792
500 years...

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:25.500
We've found the Longevity Monk at last

00:33:32.458 --> 00:33:34.417
The hair on the sole has shaved off

00:33:34.625 --> 00:33:37.167
I don't know when it will grow again

00:33:45.583 --> 00:33:49.375
Shit! They come first!

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:52.125
I have to inform

00:33:52.458 --> 00:33:53.833
these innocent people

00:34:16.083 --> 00:34:18.833
You come back to Waterfall Cave again?

00:34:19.042 --> 00:34:20.042
Waterfall Cave?

00:34:20.375 --> 00:34:21.167
Who are you?

00:34:21.458 --> 00:34:22.792
Why do you bring me here?

00:34:23.292 --> 00:34:27.208
No one brings you here
You come here on your own

00:34:27.667 --> 00:34:31.125
it is normal to miss your home

00:34:31.958 --> 00:34:32.917
Don't tease me!

00:34:33.208 --> 00:34:36.125
My home is at Mt Wuyue

00:34:36.333 --> 00:34:37.583
You have made a mistake
can you hear me?

00:34:37.833 --> 00:34:40.667
Don't annoy me, please!

00:34:43.417 --> 00:34:46.000
We have to go, Master, or we'll be late

00:34:46.167 --> 00:34:46.792
Go? What do you wanna do?

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.167
Robbery!

00:34:48.375 --> 00:34:49.083
Who dare to do so?

00:34:49.375 --> 00:34:50.458
We go to rob!

00:34:50.667 --> 00:34:51.958
Ok, that's fine!

00:34:56.167 --> 00:35:01.583
Go to rob...

00:35:03.375 --> 00:35:04.125
What?

00:35:04.333 --> 00:35:05.250
Rob the sole

00:35:05.458 --> 00:35:06.875
I have no legs. What to do?

00:35:12.958 --> 00:35:14.167
What are you looking at?

00:35:14.458 --> 00:35:16.583
Are you jealous of my handsomely
shaved face?

00:35:16.958 --> 00:35:18.125
That's fine

00:35:18.333 --> 00:35:19.375
Yes...

00:35:19.625 --> 00:35:20.708
Jealous! You guys...

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.125
Shut up!

00:35:23.833 --> 00:35:26.333
Grapes?

00:35:32.208 --> 00:35:33.792
Master, the grapes are washed

00:35:33.833 --> 00:35:34.333
Go out

00:35:34.667 --> 00:35:35.167
The dinner is ready

00:35:35.208 --> 00:35:36.250
Go out!

00:35:39.833 --> 00:35:40.875
Who?

00:35:44.167 --> 00:35:46.417
I'm the grapes that you bring here!

00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:48.083
You're grapes?

00:35:49.208 --> 00:35:51.417
No, I'm Grandma Ada?

00:35:51.958 --> 00:35:53.000
What Grandma Ada?

00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:55.000
Stop the non-sense

00:35:55.250 --> 00:35:56.833
I'm Grandpa Buddha, an immortal

00:35:57.042 --> 00:35:58.792
I turned myself into grapes and save you

00:35:59.542 --> 00:36:02.833
You stole my grapes and forbid me
mentioning Grandma

00:36:03.042 --> 00:36:04.958
Both women are devils

00:36:05.417 --> 00:36:06.542
If you don't believe me

00:36:06.792 --> 00:36:08.958
you can use my Magic Mirror!

00:36:09.208 --> 00:36:10.542
I use your Mom's mirror!

00:36:10.833 --> 00:36:11.542
Say! Listen to me

00:36:11.792 --> 00:36:12.583
Have you stolen my grapes?

00:36:12.833 --> 00:36:13.667
No!

00:36:13.875 --> 00:36:15.333
Where are my grapes!

00:36:15.542 --> 00:36:16.125
I'm your grapes!

00:36:16.375 --> 00:36:17.375
Louder!

00:36:17.708 --> 00:36:19.042
I'm your grapes

00:36:19.333 --> 00:36:22.208
Why aren't you an apple?

00:36:22.542 --> 00:36:23.708
Listen to me

00:36:24.125 --> 00:36:25.333
You shouldn't think I can't defeat you

00:36:25.625 --> 00:36:27.167
I don't wanna hurt innocent people

00:36:27.417 --> 00:36:28.375
Go out!

00:36:28.625 --> 00:36:29.917
You will be seriously hurt!

00:36:32.583 --> 00:36:33.667
Jing Jing!

00:36:33.958 --> 00:36:34.792
Your beard looks great!

00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:36.083
Really?

00:36:36.583 --> 00:36:37.875
Why was it so noisy?

00:36:38.292 --> 00:36:40.208
Just beating the grapes

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:44.958
Who're gonna beat grapes?

00:36:45.625 --> 00:36:47.083
Meal time

00:36:47.875 --> 00:36:49.125
Meal time

00:36:49.375 --> 00:36:50.042
That's great!

00:36:50.333 --> 00:36:51.000
Great?

00:36:51.292 --> 00:36:53.458
What a pretty moon. Let'...

00:36:55.042 --> 00:36:57.083
Moon? I can't see it

00:36:57.375 --> 00:37:00.042
There is a big moon. Can you see it?

00:37:00.333 --> 00:37:02.417
It's not dark yet
how come is there a moon?

00:37:02.667 --> 00:37:03.708
Tell me...

00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:10.333
Who? Who the hell...!

00:37:10.542 --> 00:37:11.667
Who the hell?

00:37:11.917 --> 00:37:12.708
I was turned into grapes

00:37:12.875 --> 00:37:13.583
Where are you?

00:37:13.792 --> 00:37:14.833
In your trousers

00:37:15.917 --> 00:37:17.208
Big grapes!

00:37:17.417 --> 00:37:19.250
It's yours. I'm at your back!

00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:21.500
That's great to see you

00:37:21.792 --> 00:37:22.417
You trust me now!

00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:23.792
Yes, I trust you

00:37:24.625 --> 00:37:26.542
Why do we have devil here?

00:37:26.792 --> 00:37:30.167
Stupid fool, listen to me

00:37:30.333 --> 00:37:34.333
These devils are waiting for the
Longevity Monk

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:36.292
Longevity Monk?

00:37:38.583 --> 00:37:42.000
500 years ago
Monkey King was destroyed by Goddess

00:37:42.208 --> 00:37:43.958
His master Longevity Monk wanted to
save him

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:45.083
He exchanged the monkey's life

00:37:45.375 --> 00:37:47.750
with his own

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.958
He hoped this monkey would be good

00:37:50.125 --> 00:37:51.708
Why does the Longevity Monk

00:37:51.958 --> 00:37:52.958
need to appear?

00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:57.250
he wanted to save the whole world

00:37:57.458 --> 00:37:59.917
so he went to India and tried to get
scriptures

00:38:00.125 --> 00:38:02.458
he hoped they would do good to
the people

00:38:02.708 --> 00:38:05.750
All devils were impressed by his spirit

00:38:06.042 --> 00:38:07.583
heaven Emperor saw that

00:38:07.792 --> 00:38:09.792
He gave the monkey a chance to revive

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:11.958
He planned the master and the disciple
to meet here

00:38:12.167 --> 00:38:14.542
Then they can finish the journey
to the west

00:38:15.333 --> 00:38:17.167
Now, you know why there are so many
devils here

00:38:17.208 --> 00:38:18.667
You got it

00:38:20.542 --> 00:38:22.750
So I am having the same

00:38:22.792 --> 00:38:24.042
dream

00:38:24.292 --> 00:38:27.583
In a pitch-dark area

00:38:27.792 --> 00:38:30.333
a pair of seductive eyes

00:38:30.542 --> 00:38:32.042
Iooking at me

00:38:32.417 --> 00:38:34.458
make me embarrassed

00:38:34.750 --> 00:38:35.792
Your eyes look like the eyes in my dream

00:38:36.042 --> 00:38:38.000
Sometimes, my face becomes red

00:38:38.250 --> 00:38:40.167
I have to face the devils tonight!

00:38:40.375 --> 00:38:43.083
Yes! You are facing devils tonight!

00:38:43.333 --> 00:38:45.333
Two Magic Bags here
and some invisible stickers

00:38:45.583 --> 00:38:47.708
You're invisible if you stick one on
your body

00:38:47.917 --> 00:38:50.125
Cover him by it when he is not aware

00:38:50.333 --> 00:38:52.125
I'll cover you up from the back

00:38:52.542 --> 00:38:54.333
This is my line!

00:38:54.542 --> 00:38:55.500
Whom are you talking to?

00:38:55.750 --> 00:38:56.792
To him

00:38:57.833 --> 00:39:01.042
Let me help you!

00:39:01.458 --> 00:39:03.208
That's great! You're my good bro

00:39:03.417 --> 00:39:04.750
Tell all bros to come in

00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:05.833
give a magic sticker to each of them

00:39:05.958 --> 00:39:07.500
I go back to get the Magic Bag

00:39:07.792 --> 00:39:08.708
Then we can catch all the devils

00:39:08.750 --> 00:39:09.708
No problem

00:39:09.917 --> 00:39:10.875
Good brother

00:39:13.542 --> 00:39:14.833
Your eyes today...

00:39:14.875 --> 00:39:15.625
Are they seductive?

00:39:15.667 --> 00:39:16.708
Yes

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:23.792
I will help you

00:39:37.958 --> 00:39:39.708
Help yourself!

00:39:40.625 --> 00:39:41.625
What to do?

00:39:41.875 --> 00:39:43.208
It is Master's order

00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:44.500
You wait a moment

00:39:44.833 --> 00:39:45.792
Asst. Master

00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:50.458
Tell the others, Master is looking for us

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:51.500
Go

00:39:57.667 --> 00:39:59.458
Invisible sticker

00:39:59.792 --> 00:40:01.667
Go...

00:40:06.667 --> 00:40:07.542
Sister

00:40:07.750 --> 00:40:08.667
OK...

00:40:08.875 --> 00:40:10.667
Let's keep quiet and see what they want

00:40:23.708 --> 00:40:25.292
Sister, drink!

00:40:39.625 --> 00:40:41.125
Sister, you drink too

00:40:47.833 --> 00:40:48.875
What are you doing?

00:40:49.833 --> 00:40:52.167
I'm drunk. I wanna sleep

00:40:52.833 --> 00:40:54.583
don't be afraid. We're invisible

00:40:54.792 --> 00:40:57.375
You shouldn't drink so much if you
cannot drink

00:41:17.708 --> 00:41:19.125
We're invisible

00:41:19.542 --> 00:41:20.542
You can see nothing all the time

00:41:20.792 --> 00:41:21.667
Ok!

00:41:26.292 --> 00:41:27.833
Master hasn't come yet

00:41:28.083 --> 00:41:29.000
Yes

00:41:29.250 --> 00:41:30.458
You say there is roast chicken

00:41:40.250 --> 00:41:42.667
Master! It's burning

00:41:43.875 --> 00:41:44.875
Don't be naked

00:42:35.042 --> 00:42:36.500
Pay me back! Fool!

00:42:36.708 --> 00:42:37.875
No need to be like that?

00:42:38.083 --> 00:42:39.667
None of your business, pay me back

00:42:39.875 --> 00:42:40.708
When did I borrow money from you

00:42:40.917 --> 00:42:41.667
You owe me

00:42:42.125 --> 00:42:43.042
I owe you?

00:42:43.250 --> 00:42:43.875
Don't you remember?

00:42:44.167 --> 00:42:45.167
No...

00:42:46.458 --> 00:42:47.417
You lost your memory

00:42:47.708 --> 00:42:48.917
Sorry

00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.042
You should pay back!

00:43:12.208 --> 00:43:13.583
/No need to be like that

00:43:13.792 --> 00:43:14.667
Pay me back, or I'll ruin your face

00:43:15.083 --> 00:43:16.708
I have paid you back last month

00:43:16.958 --> 00:43:19.625
Really? Yes, yes

00:43:20.167 --> 00:43:22.292
You're old. You lost your memory

00:43:22.583 --> 00:43:25.208
Forget it, it's my fault

00:43:26.042 --> 00:43:28.083
Cut it! Cut it!

00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:31.667
That's better than nothing

00:43:31.833 --> 00:43:32.917
Fight with him! Bros!

00:43:33.250 --> 00:43:34.000
Bros, let's go!

00:43:34.042 --> 00:43:35.167
Yes!

00:43:38.375 --> 00:43:40.042
Devils, come out!

00:43:42.875 --> 00:43:44.250
Where is the Magic Bag?

00:43:44.750 --> 00:43:48.208
The Magic Bag is here
They wanna frame you

00:43:49.042 --> 00:43:51.417
Traitor, you betray me

00:43:54.792 --> 00:43:56.417
Today, you betray me

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:58.000
I will betray you one day

00:43:58.208 --> 00:43:59.375
Really?

00:43:59.625 --> 00:44:00.875
Yes!

00:44:04.583 --> 00:44:06.625
I want to destroy all devils

00:44:06.917 --> 00:44:08.167
I can take off my underwear!

00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.083
Master, there's really something wrong
with Asst. Master

00:44:15.250 --> 00:44:17.250
That guy is unwilling to do anything
even if I beg him

00:44:17.500 --> 00:44:19.375
Now, he admit so quickly
There must be something wrong

00:44:19.583 --> 00:44:20.250
Pull him out

00:44:20.292 --> 00:44:21.583
Yes!

00:44:23.542 --> 00:44:24.458
Let me go...

00:44:25.667 --> 00:44:26.625
Let me go

00:44:26.875 --> 00:44:27.750
Shut up

00:44:28.167 --> 00:44:30.167
Let me go

00:44:30.375 --> 00:44:31.708
Kneel down

00:44:32.083 --> 00:44:35.417
You son of a bitch
I'm gonna kill you tonight

00:44:35.667 --> 00:44:36.625
Fine!

00:44:37.208 --> 00:44:38.500
You can't blame him

00:44:38.792 --> 00:44:41.458
He's only mesmerized by both devils

00:44:42.875 --> 00:44:43.625
Let me go

00:44:43.875 --> 00:44:45.000
or I'll tell my Master to kill you

00:44:45.542 --> 00:44:46.750
Shut up!

00:44:49.250 --> 00:44:50.125
Wong Choi

00:44:50.667 --> 00:44:53.167
The string you're biting is so familiar

00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:53.875
Stranger

00:44:54.125 --> 00:44:56.458
It is the string for my Magic Bag

00:44:59.625 --> 00:45:00.542
Son of a bitch

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.458
How dare you come here!

00:45:05.417 --> 00:45:06.417
Come here!

00:45:06.708 --> 00:45:08.708
I'll kill you, reincarnated Monkey King

00:45:08.917 --> 00:45:11.042
Then you won't find the Longevity Monk

00:45:11.375 --> 00:45:12.167
What?

00:45:12.667 --> 00:45:13.667
He is the Monkey King?

00:45:15.167 --> 00:45:16.375
Say you're the Monkey King

00:45:16.625 --> 00:45:18.167
or we'll all die

00:45:18.375 --> 00:45:19.375
He's not the Monkey King

00:45:19.625 --> 00:45:20.917
He can't even withstand my Skeleton Fire

00:45:21.125 --> 00:45:22.083
He is not the Monkey King?

00:45:22.458 --> 00:45:23.375
Shit!

00:45:23.625 --> 00:45:24.958
You've exposed a top secret

00:45:25.125 --> 00:45:25.875
Really?

00:45:25.917 --> 00:45:27.250
This way

00:45:27.625 --> 00:45:29.125
Are you really a fairy?

00:45:29.375 --> 00:45:30.458
Give me your hand

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.792
It is too much of you...

00:45:33.458 --> 00:45:35.208
Do you think I can't withstand your
Skeleton Fire?

00:45:35.458 --> 00:45:36.917
Burn me again

00:45:37.167 --> 00:45:37.833
Serious?

00:45:38.375 --> 00:45:39.292
Great!

00:45:42.042 --> 00:45:44.125
I'm not scared! See?

00:45:44.417 --> 00:45:45.792
Yes!

00:45:50.250 --> 00:45:52.833
You can burn my hand if you like

00:45:53.333 --> 00:45:55.375
I'm not afraid of you

00:45:56.417 --> 00:45:58.292
Not burn my hand?

00:46:05.292 --> 00:46:06.417
Burning

00:46:10.042 --> 00:46:11.750
The hand is still OK

00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:14.542
Let go!

00:46:15.208 --> 00:46:16.708
Now you know I'm great

00:46:16.958 --> 00:46:17.792
Surrender!

00:46:18.042 --> 00:46:19.917
I have got my bros and a fairy

00:46:20.250 --> 00:46:21.042
Where are you going?

00:46:21.333 --> 00:46:22.875
I'll take revenge on you one day

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:24.708
Even a fairy is not righteous

00:46:24.958 --> 00:46:25.667
No need to ask

00:46:25.875 --> 00:46:27.792
My bros must be there

00:46:28.250 --> 00:46:29.708
Yes! Master!

00:46:30.458 --> 00:46:32.792
Sons of bitches!

00:46:33.583 --> 00:46:34.958
Are you that heartless guy?

00:46:35.167 --> 00:46:36.542
You deceived me last night!

00:46:37.833 --> 00:46:39.125
That Monkey King

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:41.250
Sister will not be married just
because of you

00:46:41.583 --> 00:46:42.458
Me?

00:46:44.875 --> 00:46:45.917
Get the Joker!

00:46:46.083 --> 00:46:47.083
Go!

00:46:47.292 --> 00:46:48.250
Stop that

00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:50.083
Master, go

00:46:59.208 --> 00:47:01.167
Don't kill my bros!

00:47:22.958 --> 00:47:24.583
Master

00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:32.958
Blindy, I'm here, no need to scare

00:47:36.417 --> 00:47:37.167
Sorry, Blindy!

00:47:37.375 --> 00:47:38.292
You have made a mistake

00:47:38.583 --> 00:47:39.833
You won't blame me, will you?

00:47:41.167 --> 00:47:43.167
For my whole life I know

00:47:43.458 --> 00:47:45.042
I'm blind...

00:47:45.917 --> 00:47:50.000
But I am right to be your follower!

00:47:53.375 --> 00:47:55.083
Kill you!

00:47:59.083 --> 00:48:00.083
You go to hell

00:48:00.333 --> 00:48:01.250
You can't kill him

00:48:01.458 --> 00:48:02.333
You still help him

00:48:02.583 --> 00:48:03.375
You want to rely on him to find
the Longevity Monk

00:48:04.250 --> 00:48:05.250
Take him back to Spider's Web Cave

00:48:09.417 --> 00:48:10.458
Sister

00:48:11.292 --> 00:48:14.583
Only one man can be benefit by it

00:48:14.833 --> 00:48:16.625
You don't know this in fact

00:48:17.208 --> 00:48:19.208
You won't gian anything even
if you hurt me

00:48:19.417 --> 00:48:20.542
Look at your palm

00:48:22.292 --> 00:48:23.333
Black Widow!

00:48:24.958 --> 00:48:26.708
You've been poisoned by my weapon

00:48:26.917 --> 00:48:28.417
You will die in 7 days

00:48:28.625 --> 00:48:30.250
if you can't get my remedy

00:48:31.333 --> 00:48:32.833
Sister, I don't dare to do so anymore

00:48:33.083 --> 00:48:34.042
Get lost!

00:48:37.833 --> 00:48:39.750
You regret at last

00:48:39.917 --> 00:48:42.250
No! A fierce thing has come

00:48:44.125 --> 00:48:45.042
Go out and have a look

00:48:47.125 --> 00:48:48.000
Where are you going?

00:48:48.250 --> 00:48:49.458
No!...

00:48:53.583 --> 00:48:54.125
King Bull has come?

00:48:54.167 --> 00:48:55.417
King Bull?

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:05.917
Pretend to be dead here?

00:49:06.167 --> 00:49:06.750
Me too...

00:49:09.917 --> 00:49:11.042
Monster

00:49:21.375 --> 00:49:22.667
Granpa Buddha

00:49:23.292 --> 00:49:24.833
Give the Longevity Monk to me

00:49:25.083 --> 00:49:25.917
or you're gonna die

00:49:26.167 --> 00:49:26.917
We have nothing to talk

00:49:27.083 --> 00:49:28.458
You are looking for the Monkey King

00:49:29.125 --> 00:49:30.958
My bro Monkey King?

00:49:31.292 --> 00:49:32.458
Where is he?

00:49:33.625 --> 00:49:34.500
This monster

00:49:34.833 --> 00:49:35.958
is the Monkey King's Bro

00:49:36.208 --> 00:49:37.250
We are saved

00:49:37.667 --> 00:49:39.333
I'm you Bro

00:49:39.583 --> 00:49:40.833
the reincamated Monkey King

00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:42.625
You?

00:49:42.875 --> 00:49:43.667
Yes...

00:49:43.875 --> 00:49:44.833
Yes! It's me

00:49:45.042 --> 00:49:47.333
I'm gonna kill you adulterer!

00:49:51.667 --> 00:49:53.792
Tell me your name, witch!

00:49:54.542 --> 00:49:55.458
I'm Boney M of Spider Devil

00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:56.792
Spider Woman

00:49:57.083 --> 00:49:59.917
In the old days when I know your masters

00:50:00.250 --> 00:50:02.417
where were you?

00:50:02.792 --> 00:50:04.833
I have no business with you...

00:50:05.125 --> 00:50:06.125
Change...

00:50:09.958 --> 00:50:12.250
I'm going to kill

00:50:12.542 --> 00:50:13.667
the ones who black my way

00:50:14.333 --> 00:50:15.667
Try my White Bone Whip!

00:50:39.250 --> 00:50:39.958
Change!

00:50:41.542 --> 00:50:42.708
Dragon Heavenly Silk!

00:50:54.375 --> 00:50:55.750
Go!

00:50:56.958 --> 00:50:58.458
It's only small trick

00:51:42.625 --> 00:51:44.250
Blindy, you're still alive!

00:51:44.958 --> 00:51:46.917
We are in trouble

00:51:47.375 --> 00:51:48.500
I admire you

00:51:51.250 --> 00:51:53.125
Don't go...

00:51:54.500 --> 00:51:56.625
Let me see what magic you have got

00:51:57.333 --> 00:51:58.417
King Bull Go

00:52:08.417 --> 00:52:09.708
My Little Buddha in hurt

00:52:09.875 --> 00:52:11.833
Another hundred years before it is healed

00:52:15.708 --> 00:52:17.458
Get up

00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:23.042
What are you doing?

00:52:25.042 --> 00:52:26.833
Master wanna see you

00:52:27.792 --> 00:52:28.917
What place is this?

00:52:29.208 --> 00:52:30.208
Spider Web Cave

00:52:31.875 --> 00:52:33.000
Spider Web Cave?

00:52:33.208 --> 00:52:34.125
Yes!

00:52:34.333 --> 00:52:36.750
I'm Spider Devil's disciple Spider Woman

00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:38.375
This is Spider Web Cave

00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.875
Spider Web Cave?

00:52:41.250 --> 00:52:42.458
Let's go! Monkey

00:52:42.708 --> 00:52:43.708
Hey, you have gone mad

00:52:43.958 --> 00:52:45.917
I'm your Master, monkey!

00:52:46.125 --> 00:52:46.917
I'm mad

00:52:47.125 --> 00:52:48.250
You are lying!

00:52:48.583 --> 00:52:49.667
You've admitted that

00:52:49.917 --> 00:52:50.792
you're the Monkey King

00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:51.625
Go!

00:52:51.958 --> 00:52:52.583
Get smart just for once

00:52:52.833 --> 00:52:53.833
I was forced to pretend

00:52:54.042 --> 00:52:56.292
you can use the Magic Mirror to
show my true identity

00:52:56.958 --> 00:52:58.042
Magic Mirror?

00:53:05.458 --> 00:53:07.667
Can you see it?

00:53:07.917 --> 00:53:08.792
Yes

00:53:09.083 --> 00:53:10.083
Clear?

00:53:11.542 --> 00:53:12.667
Deceive me!

00:53:12.875 --> 00:53:14.667
This is not the Magic Mirror

00:53:15.625 --> 00:53:17.625
Pig!

00:53:18.583 --> 00:53:20.500
Sister, have pity on me

00:53:21.375 --> 00:53:22.458
Stay calm

00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:25.292
I guarantee that you can trust

00:53:25.625 --> 00:53:26.750
my word this time

00:53:27.167 --> 00:53:27.833
Master!

00:53:28.167 --> 00:53:28.792
Master!

00:53:29.042 --> 00:53:30.625
Master! The monkey has come

00:53:31.792 --> 00:53:34.458
Where is the Longevity Monk?

00:53:36.542 --> 00:53:38.667
Big misunderstanding, everybody

00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.042
How big?

00:53:40.333 --> 00:53:41.333
Let me tell you secretly

00:53:41.667 --> 00:53:43.583
I was born in the Year of Monkey
but I'm not the Monkey King

00:53:43.958 --> 00:53:44.542
A waste of time!

00:53:44.833 --> 00:53:45.417
I have got the Magic Mirror and
everything

00:53:45.708 --> 00:53:46.417
You can use the mirror on me

00:53:46.667 --> 00:53:47.458
Fake mirror

00:53:47.708 --> 00:53:48.333
how dare you use the fake mirror...

00:53:48.583 --> 00:53:49.875
Now! Stop playing game

00:53:50.625 --> 00:53:51.875
If I'm the Monkey King

00:53:52.167 --> 00:53:53.292
why am I standing here for you to bite
my hand?

00:53:53.583 --> 00:53:54.292
I could jump to the sky

00:53:54.542 --> 00:53:56.625
Then shit on your heads

00:53:56.875 --> 00:53:57.750
You haven't changed to be
Monkey King yet

00:53:58.042 --> 00:53:59.667
You'll shit at that time

00:53:59.875 --> 00:54:01.708
What is it, sister?

00:54:02.708 --> 00:54:03.792
Broken hearted?

00:54:04.458 --> 00:54:05.208
No

00:54:05.458 --> 00:54:06.583
No?

00:54:08.333 --> 00:54:10.667
I won't be hurt by this man again

00:54:12.167 --> 00:54:13.250
you are lying to me!

00:54:14.292 --> 00:54:16.208
Sister, I'm not lying to you

00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.167
Then kill him

00:54:19.667 --> 00:54:20.917
Kill him

00:54:21.625 --> 00:54:23.125
Don't you want to find
the Longevity Monk?

00:54:23.833 --> 00:54:26.500
Yes! But I don't think you will kill him

00:54:31.958 --> 00:54:33.792
Not accurate...

00:54:34.042 --> 00:54:35.125
Give the sword!

00:54:37.208 --> 00:54:39.042
Give! Understand

00:54:41.792 --> 00:54:42.625
Kill him!

00:54:43.292 --> 00:54:44.417
You've sliced a piece of my thigh out

00:54:44.667 --> 00:54:45.417
I intended to do that

00:54:45.625 --> 00:54:46.750
Give me a bill and I'll pay you back

00:54:46.958 --> 00:54:47.792
You're welcome

00:54:48.250 --> 00:54:49.375
I kill you!

00:54:52.750 --> 00:54:55.750
Cheap whore, you still love that monkey

00:54:55.958 --> 00:54:57.458
Stop that, I'm gonna kill you

00:55:13.542 --> 00:55:14.583
Are you Ok?

00:55:19.542 --> 00:55:22.375
You're still concerned about me

00:55:22.792 --> 00:55:26.042
I'm gonna love forever onwards

00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:33.208
They are outside

00:55:33.417 --> 00:55:34.500
Can this door block them?

00:55:34.750 --> 00:55:36.958
this door is mad of unbreakable steel

00:55:40.292 --> 00:55:41.333
Stand aside

00:55:44.542 --> 00:55:47.208
Sister, do you remember
how he treated you in the past?

00:55:47.750 --> 00:55:49.542
He deceived you, refused to marry you

00:55:49.792 --> 00:55:51.542
You had a good marriage with
Chilian Immortal

00:55:51.792 --> 00:55:52.750
He ruined it

00:55:53.042 --> 00:55:53.917
He can do nothing now

00:55:54.125 --> 00:55:54.917
When he returned to his own image

00:55:55.208 --> 00:55:56.083
he'll leave you

00:55:56.333 --> 00:55:57.333
Have you finished? Son of bitch!

00:55:57.625 --> 00:55:59.167
Damn monkey
how dare you call me a bitch!

00:55:59.417 --> 00:56:00.708
Scold me, son of a bitch

00:56:01.292 --> 00:56:03.250
Don't think it's safe to hide inside

00:56:03.458 --> 00:56:04.917
it's full moon tonight

00:56:05.125 --> 00:56:06.583
She will become a zombie!

00:56:10.292 --> 00:56:12.083
I don't scare, son of a bitch

00:56:18.917 --> 00:56:19.875
What?

00:56:20.167 --> 00:56:22.708
There are many hills and caves here

00:56:22.958 --> 00:56:24.542
We don't know
where the Spider Web Cave is?

00:56:24.583 --> 00:56:25.917
Yes...

00:56:26.125 --> 00:56:29.792
More than the bugs in my body. Search!

00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:02.833
What are you doing?

00:57:03.250 --> 00:57:05.792
How about inside? Are you fine?

00:57:06.083 --> 00:57:07.417
Of course I'm alright

00:57:07.667 --> 00:57:09.083
We are very happy

00:57:10.917 --> 00:57:12.708
Jing Jing is till very pretty

00:57:12.917 --> 00:57:14.542
I'm still very handsome

00:57:14.750 --> 00:57:15.958
We are still very good-looking

00:57:16.250 --> 00:57:17.542
Meal time, Ma'am 30th

00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.625
Help...

00:57:24.208 --> 00:57:25.250
Zombie!

00:57:25.417 --> 00:57:26.083
Open the door!

00:57:26.375 --> 00:57:26.875
I can't open it!

00:57:27.208 --> 00:57:28.167
Kiss her, breath life to her

00:57:28.792 --> 00:57:30.500
Maybe it will be stopped

00:57:32.667 --> 00:57:33.833
Scare me!

00:57:35.292 --> 00:57:37.208
Sister, you can't defeat me

00:57:37.375 --> 00:57:38.333
Really?

00:57:39.292 --> 00:57:41.458
I'll break you neck if you move

00:57:43.125 --> 00:57:45.042
Give me the key! Lock him up

00:57:46.208 --> 00:57:47.917
You wanna go inside

00:57:47.958 --> 00:57:48.875
Now you can go

00:57:51.333 --> 00:57:52.625
Goodbye!

00:58:06.917 --> 00:58:09.500
Please stop taking revenge

00:58:12.583 --> 00:58:14.125
Listen to my suggestions

00:58:15.125 --> 00:58:16.958
You can beat me
but please don't hit my face...

00:58:21.125 --> 00:58:23.125
Stop beat my cock, thanks

00:58:23.500 --> 00:58:25.125
There is a chicken, Ma'am 30th

00:58:30.333 --> 00:58:31.333
I'm telling you

00:58:40.958 --> 00:58:42.917
No reactions after a kiss

00:58:43.167 --> 00:58:44.042
Don't lock it up

00:58:47.333 --> 00:58:49.250
Ok, since you refuse to open the door

00:58:49.583 --> 00:58:50.750
I warn you

00:58:51.042 --> 00:58:54.000
I'll rape and kill your lover

00:58:58.125 --> 00:58:58.958
One

00:59:09.250 --> 00:59:10.042
Two

00:59:13.375 --> 00:59:14.708
I get it

00:59:19.375 --> 00:59:20.292
Three

00:59:24.292 --> 00:59:26.083
Seductive magic

00:59:35.625 --> 00:59:36.625
Go!

00:59:45.167 --> 00:59:46.167
What are you doing?

00:59:46.833 --> 00:59:48.417
I have just shivered for a while

00:59:49.167 --> 00:59:50.417
Very interesting

00:59:50.708 --> 00:59:52.208
You shivered on my body?

00:59:52.917 --> 00:59:53.958
Yes

00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:56.833
Oh god!

01:00:20.167 --> 01:00:22.375
It must be better if she's not a devil!

01:00:31.875 --> 01:00:33.458
You're poisoned

01:00:34.958 --> 01:00:36.875
You'll die if you don't cured

01:00:37.375 --> 01:00:38.500
What for even if I'm cured?

01:00:39.125 --> 01:00:41.583
Living long is meaningless
if you are unhappy

01:00:41.917 --> 01:00:45.542
Your last few days will be great
if you're happy

01:00:47.292 --> 01:00:48.625
If I tell you I'm the Monkey King

01:00:48.875 --> 01:00:49.875
what do you think?

01:00:50.583 --> 01:00:51.708
I will kill you

01:00:52.583 --> 01:00:53.958
I'm not him

01:00:54.750 --> 01:00:55.833
This is a magic mirror

01:00:56.042 --> 01:00:56.833
You should use it

01:00:57.250 --> 01:00:58.667
You're not him, really?

01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:00.542
I'm not

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:02.625
Don't you scare that I will kill you?

01:01:03.125 --> 01:01:05.542
Yes, but I have no option

01:01:06.833 --> 01:01:08.958
Because I don't want you to look at me

01:01:09.750 --> 01:01:11.958
while you're thinking of another

01:01:14.375 --> 01:01:15.917
I would like to kill you

01:01:16.750 --> 01:01:19.042
You said living long was meaningless

01:01:19.292 --> 01:01:20.750
if you were unhappy

01:02:12.875 --> 01:02:13.750
Go ahead!

01:02:13.958 --> 01:02:15.083
Yes, I'll

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:28.125
Shit! Who make this knot?

01:02:28.375 --> 01:02:29.458
Let me do it!

01:02:38.875 --> 01:02:41.375
Sorry, I don't mean it

01:02:41.958 --> 01:02:43.042
You do it strongly

01:02:43.458 --> 01:02:44.708
So I wanna do it with you

01:02:45.167 --> 01:02:46.542
Although I'm not a righteous man

01:02:46.750 --> 01:02:48.000
I won't take advantages from the others

01:02:49.208 --> 01:02:50.375
I'm not used to do it at daytime

01:02:51.250 --> 01:02:52.708
Let's wait till night

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.458
No matter when

01:03:01.917 --> 01:03:03.750
call me if you need me

01:03:04.750 --> 01:03:05.833
From now on

01:03:06.167 --> 01:03:07.792
I'll be with you

01:03:19.375 --> 01:03:20.000
Can you get him?

01:03:20.042 --> 01:03:20.667
No

01:03:20.708 --> 01:03:22.000
Go on

01:03:45.250 --> 01:03:46.958
Damn!

01:03:47.417 --> 01:03:49.833
I'm so pretty

01:03:50.083 --> 01:03:52.875
But I have a baby with such an ugly man

01:03:58.708 --> 01:03:59.667
Ma'am 30th

01:03:59.875 --> 01:04:01.042
Shut up!

01:04:01.750 --> 01:04:03.875
I will kill you if I'm not pregnant

01:04:05.292 --> 01:04:06.000
Thanks

01:04:06.250 --> 01:04:07.417
Why are you so happy?

01:04:08.458 --> 01:04:09.750
Tell you...

01:04:09.958 --> 01:04:10.542
Don't tell the baby

01:04:10.792 --> 01:04:13.083
you're his father

01:04:14.292 --> 01:04:15.375
What should I be?

01:04:15.542 --> 01:04:16.750
His maiden

01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.542
I'm a man. I can't be a maiden!

01:04:19.292 --> 01:04:20.417
We bring him up

01:04:20.625 --> 01:04:22.792
He don't know if a maiden is
a man or woman

01:04:23.667 --> 01:04:24.708
That's right

01:04:27.833 --> 01:04:30.292
I've found a guy just like you

01:04:42.250 --> 01:04:43.250
It's you?

01:04:45.875 --> 01:04:48.583
Do you wanna know
where the Longevity Monk is?

01:04:51.125 --> 01:04:52.083
Yes, I do

01:04:52.708 --> 01:04:54.167
Don't strike back if you do

01:04:57.792 --> 01:05:00.500
you have to pay for the flesh of
the Longevity Monk

01:05:00.708 --> 01:05:01.750
It worths!

01:05:04.125 --> 01:05:06.292
If you give me the medication for
Jing Jing

01:05:06.542 --> 01:05:07.875
I will tell you
where the Longevity Monk is

01:05:08.875 --> 01:05:10.458
You just do it for that bitch

01:05:11.667 --> 01:05:13.833
I like to do so

01:05:19.708 --> 01:05:21.208
Maiden

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:25.875
Maiden is kissing you

01:05:33.042 --> 01:05:35.167
Ok, let's go by tomorrow

01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.500
Because of love

01:05:44.292 --> 01:05:49.750
you can ruin my face if you like

01:05:55.250 --> 01:05:56.708
Hurry up, do you wanna save someone?

01:05:56.958 --> 01:05:58.042
Just let me do it!

01:06:08.708 --> 01:06:09.583
Joker

01:06:09.792 --> 01:06:11.375
Sister can't take this anymore
You go ahead!

01:06:11.583 --> 01:06:13.750
Let me...do that

01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:25.583
Not here

01:06:32.042 --> 01:06:33.708
Everyone deceives me

01:06:37.292 --> 01:06:40.083
We'll reach the Buddha Cave after
climbing this hill

01:06:42.667 --> 01:06:45.583
No, Ah!

01:06:46.583 --> 01:06:48.042
Jing Jing!

01:06:49.208 --> 01:06:51.417
Jing Jing!

01:06:57.125 --> 01:06:58.958
She thought I left her alone

01:06:59.667 --> 01:07:00.625
How long will you search?

01:07:00.875 --> 01:07:02.125
Jing Jing

01:07:02.375 --> 01:07:04.042
She's poisoned, must have died and
fell down from the cliff

01:07:06.583 --> 01:07:08.792
It's all because of you

01:07:09.042 --> 01:07:10.333
You shouldn't let me sleep for
a whole night

01:07:10.375 --> 01:07:11.167
I should come here as soon as possible

01:07:11.458 --> 01:07:12.292
You should whip the horse strongly

01:07:12.333 --> 01:07:13.208
We can be faster!

01:07:13.542 --> 01:07:14.583
I won't tell you
where the Longevity Monk is

01:07:14.625 --> 01:07:15.750
I don't know anything

01:07:17.083 --> 01:07:18.625
How dare you put the blame on me!

01:07:21.792 --> 01:07:22.542
What?

01:07:22.708 --> 01:07:25.500
We discovered that Boney M fainted
under the cliff

01:07:25.708 --> 01:07:27.333
Granpa Buddha has died

01:07:29.375 --> 01:07:30.792
God is helping me!

01:07:33.083 --> 01:07:34.125
Go in!

01:07:35.875 --> 01:07:36.750
If you don't tell me

01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.083
you can't go out

01:07:41.458 --> 01:07:42.417
I won't listen to you

01:07:47.875 --> 01:07:51.250
The ground is not so hard

01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:57.208
Powerful devil, extraordinary energy!

01:07:58.792 --> 01:07:59.792
I will cure your wound but

01:08:00.042 --> 01:08:02.542
you must take me to the Cave to get
the incarnated monkey

01:08:02.792 --> 01:08:03.917
We'll find the Longevity Monk sooner
or later

01:08:04.167 --> 01:08:06.208
You can also eat the flesh of
the Longevity Monk

01:08:06.542 --> 01:08:08.875
or you will die painfully

01:08:14.125 --> 01:08:15.750
I have to come out
even if I have to dig a tunnel

01:08:20.208 --> 01:08:23.042
I can move freely in time and space with
the power of moon

01:08:26.792 --> 01:08:28.000
What is it?

01:08:45.500 --> 01:08:48.125
This is the Indian language

01:08:49.875 --> 01:08:51.792
The Pandora's Box

01:08:54.250 --> 01:08:56.208
The treasure left behind by
Spider Web Devil?

01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:27.417
Take me into the Cave

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:32.125
Why does the belly feel painful?

01:09:32.375 --> 01:09:33.333
Is it coming?

01:09:34.458 --> 01:09:35.708
Where am I?

01:09:35.917 --> 01:09:36.708
Why so many traps?

01:09:36.958 --> 01:09:38.042
It becomes wetter and wetter

01:10:17.917 --> 01:10:20.250
Welcome, our King!

01:10:31.625 --> 01:10:33.083
Damn! I've met a ghost!

01:10:34.875 --> 01:10:37.125
What's going on?

01:10:37.792 --> 01:10:38.792
You love the Longevity Monk

01:10:39.083 --> 01:10:40.792
so I play him to make you happy

01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:41.625
What are you doing?

01:10:41.958 --> 01:10:43.083
I'm helping you to give birth!

01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.167
The head is coming out!

01:10:45.750 --> 01:10:46.875
Really, I've no feeling

01:10:46.917 --> 01:10:47.917
You see?

01:10:48.375 --> 01:10:49.500
This is my knee

01:10:49.833 --> 01:10:51.042
So there is no hair

01:10:51.458 --> 01:10:52.292
Someone's coming

01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.417
Hide up, be quick

01:10:59.542 --> 01:11:00.542
I'm hurt

01:11:00.833 --> 01:11:01.958
I'm hurt, too

01:11:02.250 --> 01:11:04.042
Please let go of your hand! Alright!

01:11:14.792 --> 01:11:15.917
Goddess

01:11:17.417 --> 01:11:20.083
Monkey King
you'd committed serious offences

01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:23.625
I hope you know you're wrong

01:11:23.833 --> 01:11:24.833
Who's talking?

01:11:25.333 --> 01:11:28.667
500 years ago
your master Longevity Monk sacrificed

01:11:28.875 --> 01:11:30.042
his life to save you

01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:31.750
Heaven Emperor planned that

01:11:32.042 --> 01:11:34.000
you revive after 500 years

01:11:34.250 --> 01:11:35.958
I hope you'll be like your master

01:11:36.292 --> 01:11:37.375
Making sacrifices to save the others

01:11:37.667 --> 01:11:39.750
To clean the sin that you've made before

01:11:40.083 --> 01:11:42.208
You should put on the Gold Ring
on your head

01:11:42.417 --> 01:11:43.667
Admit you sin

01:11:43.917 --> 01:11:46.792
Then you'll become
the super Monkey King

01:11:47.167 --> 01:11:50.042
You'll take the responsibility to get
scriptures in the west

01:11:50.333 --> 01:11:51.375
Rewrite the history

01:11:51.625 --> 01:11:54.000
All things in human life is then
none of your business

01:11:54.208 --> 01:11:56.625
you can't have any desires anymore

01:11:56.833 --> 01:11:58.583
Worship Buddha whole-heartedly

01:11:59.083 --> 01:12:01.625
You haven't turned into the Monkey King

01:12:01.958 --> 01:12:03.167
because you haven't met the guy

01:12:03.208 --> 01:12:05.083
who gives you the 3 birthmarks

01:12:05.375 --> 01:12:06.583
After you see him

01:12:06.833 --> 01:12:08.625
your whole life will be changed

01:12:11.083 --> 01:12:12.417
Talking to me?

01:12:13.083 --> 01:12:14.583
I don't think so

01:12:15.417 --> 01:12:17.625
I think you have made a mistake

01:12:19.458 --> 01:12:20.375
Crazy!

01:12:20.792 --> 01:12:23.250
Painful...

01:12:23.583 --> 01:12:24.708
Let go!

01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:28.750
Keep calm please No

01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.458
Keep calm

01:12:30.958 --> 01:12:33.375
I'm painful

01:12:33.667 --> 01:12:35.083
I'm painful, too

01:12:42.292 --> 01:12:43.208
Mind the traps here

01:12:45.125 --> 01:12:45.917
Chase

01:12:46.208 --> 01:12:47.167
Go!

01:12:47.917 --> 01:12:49.000
Come her and grab me

01:12:50.292 --> 01:12:53.292
Ok, do it...Ok! It's coming

01:12:55.625 --> 01:12:57.125
The Longevity Monk was born
go to get him!

01:12:57.167 --> 01:12:58.167
Yes!

01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.208
The baby looks like you

01:13:08.625 --> 01:13:09.875
I think

01:13:10.292 --> 01:13:11.583
being an immortal or not is not important

01:13:12.125 --> 01:13:14.458
The flesh of the Longevity Monk
isn't must, too

01:13:15.125 --> 01:13:18.000
We have to live together happily

01:13:18.500 --> 01:13:19.875
Bring our son up

01:13:20.125 --> 01:13:21.917
Don't let him be robber

01:13:22.917 --> 01:13:24.167
You want the Longevity Monk most

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.625
Just call him Longevity

01:13:28.500 --> 01:13:29.500
Who?

01:13:29.750 --> 01:13:31.542
It is too coincident

01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:32.958
What do you want?

01:13:34.500 --> 01:13:35.792
Your baby?

01:13:38.083 --> 01:13:40.375
My baby with Joker!

01:13:41.958 --> 01:13:43.083
What are you talking about?

01:13:45.250 --> 01:13:47.750
Maiden, tell him

01:13:48.750 --> 01:13:49.875
Tell him!

01:13:55.708 --> 01:13:56.875
Yes!

01:13:58.917 --> 01:14:01.125
this is her baby with Joker

01:14:05.792 --> 01:14:06.667
Go!

01:14:08.708 --> 01:14:09.917
See where you can go

01:14:10.250 --> 01:14:11.250
No need to scare, I'm gonna protect you

01:14:11.833 --> 01:14:12.583
Who the hell you are?

01:14:12.792 --> 01:14:13.708
You're not qualified to protect me

01:14:14.125 --> 01:14:15.042
Get lost

01:14:15.958 --> 01:14:16.917
take my son away

01:14:20.875 --> 01:14:21.667
Come here!

01:14:21.875 --> 01:14:22.792
Give me the Longevity Monk

01:14:23.333 --> 01:14:24.458
I'm not calling you to come

01:14:25.958 --> 01:14:26.667
This is my son

01:14:26.875 --> 01:14:27.917
not the Longevity Monk

01:14:28.125 --> 01:14:29.208
Help!

01:14:30.875 --> 01:14:33.375
Help...

01:14:33.708 --> 01:14:36.208
You're concerned about me
I'll die for you

01:14:46.833 --> 01:14:47.542
Take my son away

01:14:47.750 --> 01:14:48.542
Don't go!

01:14:48.708 --> 01:14:49.792
Go

01:14:50.417 --> 01:14:51.417
Ma'am 30th

01:14:56.458 --> 01:14:57.708
It is lucky that we can go out

01:15:09.333 --> 01:15:10.500
Jing Jing

01:15:36.083 --> 01:15:37.042
Honey

01:15:38.542 --> 01:15:39.375
Tortoise Magic

01:15:42.375 --> 01:15:43.333
Slash your liver, stomach

01:15:43.583 --> 01:15:44.667
and internal organs!

01:15:48.292 --> 01:15:49.458
Tie it with a knot

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.292
Here comes the spirit

01:15:55.583 --> 01:15:57.292
Bitch, don't step on my intestine

01:15:57.542 --> 01:15:58.667
I wanna do so

01:16:14.833 --> 01:16:16.792
Honey...!

01:16:17.833 --> 01:16:18.833
My wife is inside

01:16:18.875 --> 01:16:19.958
Please help me!

01:16:20.208 --> 01:16:21.042
I'm not free

01:16:21.417 --> 01:16:22.708
Thanks!

01:16:24.917 --> 01:16:25.542
Come out!

01:16:25.708 --> 01:16:26.500
Go!

01:16:30.417 --> 01:16:32.250
Can we go back to the past?

01:16:40.333 --> 01:16:42.250
Hurry up! Go!

01:16:42.458 --> 01:16:43.792
I won't! Let's go together

01:16:44.625 --> 01:16:45.500
Listen to me

01:16:46.583 --> 01:16:48.250
Bring up my son

01:16:52.500 --> 01:16:53.458
Go!

01:16:56.542 --> 01:16:58.750
Our son! Honey!

01:16:59.625 --> 01:17:00.875
you have to leave or I'll die!

01:17:01.917 --> 01:17:03.042
No!

01:17:10.542 --> 01:17:14.792
Honey...Honey...

01:17:15.333 --> 01:17:16.583
Honey!

01:17:17.292 --> 01:17:18.458
the moon is rising!

01:17:18.667 --> 01:17:19.792
Honey

01:17:21.792 --> 01:17:22.667
Ok!

01:17:23.208 --> 01:17:26.500
What's that? I've forgot that!

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:33.833
Boyi Bolomi...

01:17:35.458 --> 01:17:38.375
Being immortal!

01:17:39.750 --> 01:17:41.750
Great! We're going back to the past

01:17:43.792 --> 01:17:45.833
Wait for me!

01:17:46.583 --> 01:17:48.583
The killer is leaving

01:17:50.500 --> 01:17:55.083
Honey...My wife

01:17:55.375 --> 01:17:57.167
Your wife is coming out, easy!

01:17:58.250 --> 01:18:00.458

Why did you tell me not to disturb you?

01:18:44.833 --> 01:18:45.875
Shit! You're annoying!

01:18:46.083 --> 01:18:48.250

01:19:38.250 --> 01:19:39.417
Why did you do so?

01:19:41.208 --> 01:19:45.875

01:20:10.708 --> 01:20:11.917
Commit suicide

01:20:12.125 --> 01:20:13.667
Why commit suicide?

01:20:34.750 --> 01:20:37.792
You tell me a reason why you wanna
kill me

01:20:37.958 --> 01:20:40.042

01:23:15.042 --> 01:23:16.625
Spider Web Cave?

01:23:17.208 --> 01:23:18.292
You think I'm illiterate?

01:23:18.625 --> 01:23:19.917
Waterfall Cave

01:23:27.333 --> 01:23:30.042
Spider Web Cave. It is a good name

500 years?

01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:27.000
You haven't turned into Monkey King

01:24:27.208 --> 01:24:29.875
because you haven't met the guy having
three birthmarks

01:24:56.083 --> 01:24:57.542
